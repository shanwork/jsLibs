You think that all those whose end is near will utilize the time at their disposal to seek the vision of the Lord! Such yearning can arise in the mind only due to good deeds performed in the previous lives. Those who have acquired good merits from their past actions, have compassion towards all beings, do not swerve from the right path and adhere to truth, non-violence and love.

Just then, there was an effulgent Form with a strange splendor standing before her. Gradually, the Form became clear! It was armed with the Conch, the Discus and the Mace; the fourth hand was held in Abhaya pose. It said softly and sweetly, “Do not fear! I am Narayana. I am to be born in a few minutes as your son in an answer to the promise I made as a result of your earnest prayers. I will be known as Krishna and also as Vasudeva. As soon as I am born, the shackles will fall off from your hands and feet. The doors of the prison will open by themselves. Take Me from here without anyone’s knowledge, to the home of Nanda in Gokula. Place Me by the side of his wife, Yasoda who is having labor pains now. Bring the baby girl that Yasoda has delivered back into this prison and keep her with you. Then, send word to Kamsa. Until he gets the news, no one either in Mathura or Gokula will notice you. I shall arrange it so.” Blessing Devaki and Vasudeva, the effulgent Form entered the womb of Devaki as an Orb of Light. Within minutes the Divine Child was born! It was 3:30AM. The shackles that bound the hands and feet of Vasudeva fell off in a trice. The doors and the gates flew open. Though it was still dark, a cuckoo was cooing with a sudden spurt of joy. The Rain-God was showering flower drops of rain on the earth. Around the prison, flocks of bird clustered in happy song, twittering sweet melody.

He soon realized that it was Adisesha protecting the Lord. Though the sun had not risen yet, the lotus bloomed in all the tanks and leaned on its stalk towards the Babe. Though it was a dark night, with a deep yearning to look at the Babe, the full moon peeped through the clouds, with its cool rays illuminating the entire route to Gokul. Vasudeva began to cross Yamuna river to reach Gokul. The water was rising very rapidly above Vasudeva’s head and he was afraid that he would drown. It dawned on him that Yamuna was paying its respects to the Lord by wetting the feet of the Babe! The Babe was placed next to Yashoda and the baby girl that had just been born there was brought and placed into the hands of Devaki. No sooner this was done, Vasudeva burst into tears! While these words were coming from Suka’s lips, Parikshith exclaimed aloud, “Krishna, Krishna!” Everyone looked at the King. They saw a snake crawling away fast, after biting the right toe of the King. Suka shed tears of Bliss; He announced, “The King has merged with the Lord”. The word Suka means parrot.
