'<li>In the city of Kiratas there lived a brahmin extremely poor and deficient in (brahmanical) knowledge. He used to sell various kinds of beverage and was averse to the worship of gods or to virtuous ac tivities.</li>' +
'<li>He never practised the daily Sandhya prayers or ablutions. His practice resembled a Vaisya\'s mode of living. He never hesitated to deceive credulous persons. His name  was Devaraja.</li>' +

'<li>Thus by foul means much wealth was later accumulated by him. But the sinner that he was, not even the slightest part of his wealth was utilised in virtuous acts .</li>' +
'<li>Once that brahmin went to a lake to take his bath. There he saw a harlot called Sobhavati and was much agitated at her sight.</li>' +
'<li>The beautiful woman was extremely delighted on coming to know that a rich brahmin had become her willing slave. The brahmin\'s heart was filled with love due to her pleasant talk.</li>' +
'<li>He decided to make her his wife and she consented to have him as her husband. Thus in mutual love they sported for a long time.</li>' +
'<li>Sitting, lying, eating, drinking and playing together they were not at all different from any other wedded couple.</li>' +
'<li> Dissuaded again and· again by his mother, father, first wife and others though he was, he never paid heed to their words but continued his sinful activities.</li>' +

'<li>Enamoured of the courtesan he handed over to her his own wealth and also the wealth that he looted from his father, mother and first wife.</li>' +
'<li> In the company of this harlot he used to eat all sorts of forbidden food, became an addict to wine and spirituous liquors and partook of his food from the same plate as his concubine.</li>' +
'<li>Once, by chance, he came to the city of Pratisthana.<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (13)</note>  He saw a Siva temple where saintly men had congregated.</li>' +

He was bound with nooses</li>'+ '<li>In the mean while Siva\'s attendants dressed in white, smeared with ashes all over the body, wearing garlands of Rudraksha and wielding tridents in their hands started furiously from Sivaloka and reached Yama\'s city. They threatened the attendants of Yama (the God of death) and thrashed them. Releasing Devaraja from their clutches they seated him in a wonderful aerial chariot. When they wereabout to start to Kailasa a great tumult arose in the middle of Yama\'s city on hearing which Dharmaraja (the God of Death) himself came out of his palace.</li>' + '<li>  On seeing the four messengers who appeared like replicas of Rudra Himself, Dharmaraja the knower of virtues honoured them in accordance with the custom.</li>' +

'<li>I shall explain to you that great object attached to the glorification of Siva whereby your course hereafter will be pleasant always.</li>' +
'<li>It is by listening to the excellent story that your mind The glory of Sivapurana has now turned to the pure path of repentance and detachment towards worldly pleasures.</li>' +
'<li>Repentance is the only is the only way of acquittance for all sinners.Saintly men have extolled it as the only way of expiation for all sins.</li>' +
'<li>Purity can be realised by repentence alone. If the sinner expiates in the manner advised by saintly men it removes all sins.</li>' +
'<li>After due expiation he becomes free from fear. By repentance he attains salvation undoubtedly.</li>' +
'<li>The mental purity that one derives on hearing the story of Sivapurana cannot be gained by any other means.</li>' +
'<li>As a mirror bec~mes free from dirt on being wiped with a cloth, so is the mind undoubtedly purified by listening to this story.</li>' +
'<li>Accompanied by Amba, Siva stays in the minds of pure men. The sanctified soul thereupon attains the region of Siva and Amba.</li>' +
'<li> Hence this story is the means of realising the fourfold aim of life. It is for this that Mahadeva earnestly created this.</li>' +
'<li> Listening to the story of Parvati\'s consort (Siva) brings about steady contemplation. Contemplation leads to perfect knowledge which certainly brings in salvation.</li>' +
'<li> A person who listens to the story in this birth though he be unable to meditate, realises the same in the next birth after which he reaches the goal of Siva</li>' +

'<li> Listening to the excellent story is the cause of beatitude for all men. Properly entertained, it dispels the ailment of worldly bondage.</li>' +
'<li> Listening to the story of Siva, constant meditations thereon and repeated musings certainly purify the mind.</li>' +
'<li> That (the purity of the mind) leads the meditator to a devotion of Mahesha and his two sons (Ganesa and Kartikeya). With their blessings one undoubtedly attains liberation</li>' +
'<li>A person ·devoid of that devotion with his mind  entangled in the bondage of ignorance is a brute. He. can never be liberated from the worldly bondage.</li>' +

'<li>Your mind, as you listen to the excellent story of Siva, the Supreme Soul, will become pure and thereafter you will realise liberation.</li>' +

'<li>With devotion, may all of you be pleased to join us for imbibing the sweet juice of Sivapurana, with due reverence. </li>' +
'<li>If you do not have sufficient leisure, please grace the assembly at least for a day. By all means, do come, even for a short stay or a while. </li>' +
'<li>Thus all should be invited humbly. Those who all come should be hospitably received in all respects. </li>' +
'<li>An excellent spot for the discourse on Sivapurana must be selected in a temple of Siva, or in a holy centre or in a park or in a private house.</li>' +
'<li>The ground must be scrubbed, cleaned and smeared with cowdung. It must. be decorated with metallic materials attended with all festivities. The whole arrangement must be divinely exquisite and pleasing to diverse tastes. </li>' +
'<li>All the rubbish must be removed and all unnecessary things must be hidden in a corner away from the public v1ew. </li>' +
'<li>A high platform must be constructed, richly decorated with stumps of plantain trees. The whole place should be covered with a canopy. Fruits and flowers should be profusely used. </li>' +
'<li>Flags and banners should be hoisted in the four quarters. They should be neatly arranged to be pleasing to everyone. </li>' +
'<li>A seat must be assigned to Siva, the Supreme soul. A comfortable seat shall be assigned to the orator. </li>' +
'<li>Good places shall be reserved for the regular listeners as befitting their position. 0 sage, for the other casual visitors, seats with ordinary comfort shall be set apart. </li>' +
'<li>People must be in as pleasant a mood as on marriage occasions : all worldly worries and anxieties must be avoided. · </li>' +
'<li>The discourser faces the north and the listeners the east. There is no fear of the criss-crossings of the feet. </li>' +
'<li>Or· the discourser faces the east as the worshipper Or let the discourser and the recipient face each other. </li>' +
'<li>As long as he is seated in the seat of the discourser, the Puranist does not bow to any one before the conclusion of the discourse. </li>' +
'<li>Whether he is a boy or a youth, an old man, an indigent person, or a weakling, the scholar well-versed 1n the Purana is worthy of honour from all those who seek merit. </li>' +
'<li>Never shall anyone show demeaning disrespect towards a Purana-scholar, the speech from whose mouth is no less than the diyine cow Kamadhenu for all persons. </li>' +
'<li>Either as the cause ofbirth or of attributes there are many who may be termed "Guru" (Elder, preceptor). Among them the Pural)ic scholar is the greatest Guru. </li>' +
'<li>Who can be a greater Guru than the person who bestows the highest salvation on those who are disheartened due to the millions of births ? </li>' +
'<li>The person who undertakes to conduct a discourse on this sanctifying tale shall be well-versed in Pural).as, pure, skilful, quiet, free from malice, saintly, sympathetic and eloquent. </li>' +
'<li>The intelligent discourser shall start the narration of the story of Sivapurana at sunrise and continue it for two and a half Praharas (2.5 X 3=7.5! Hrs earnestly. </li>' +
'<li>This story shall not be narrated before rogues, wicked persons of crooked professions and those bent on conquering others in disputes and arguments. </li>' +
'<li>The discourse on this holy story shall not be conducted in a place infested by wicked men, or surrounded by thieves or in the house of a rogue. </li>' +
'<li>The orator shall have an interval of a Muhurta (forty-eight minutes) at midday for the sake of answering calls of nature. </li>' +
'<li>The discourser must have his share on the day previous to the discourse so that his vow be maintained. During the days of discourse he shall perform all his daily routine (Sandhya etc.) briefly.</li>' +
'<li>Another scholar equally well-versed in Puranas should be sitting near the discourser to help him. He must be competent to clear doubts and eager to enlighten the people. </li>' +
'<li>In order to ward off obstacles to the discourse, Ga~anatha<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (20)</note> should be worshipped. The lord of the story Siva and the book, Sivapurana, too must be worshipped with piety</li>' +
'<li>The story of Sivapurana must be listened to with careful attention. The recipient must be intelligent, pure in mind, delighted at the heart and a follower of conventions.</li>' +
'<li>If either the discourser or the recipient indulges in too many extraneous activities, is a victim of any of the six base feelings of lust, anger etc,<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (21)</note>  is enamoured of women or is a heretic he cannot gain any merit.</li>' +
'<li>Casting off the worries of worldly affairs and those of wealth, house and sons if any one of pure mind concentrates his attention on the discourse he will secure the excellent fruit. </li>' +
'<li>The recipients who are endowed with faith and piety, do not eagerly pursue other activities and are unruffled, pure and restrained in speech derive great merit. </li>' +
'<li>Base men of impious nature who listen to this holy story do not have any special merit derived out of it. They will have misery in every birth. </li>' +
'<li>Those who do not honour this Purana with presents according to their capacity are fools. Even if they listen to the story they will not be sanctified. They will become indigent. </li>' +
'<li>Those who walk out of congregation in the middle of the discourse will have the adverse effect: they will face the destruction of their wives and wealth in the midst of enjoyment. </li>' +
'<li>The sons and descendants of the people who attend the discourse with turbaned head, become sinners defiling the whole race. </li>' +
'<li>The attendants of Yama in hell force the people who chewed betel leaves while attending the discourse, to eat their own faeces. </li>' +
'<li>Those who listen to the story seated on a more elevated seat fall into hell and after undergoing the tortures there are reborn as crows. </li>' +
'<li>Those who listen to this auspicious story seated in the Vira pose<noteref3_note3footer>(3) - (22)</note> fall into hell and after undergoing the tortures of hell are reborn as poisonous plants. </li>' +
'<li>Those who listen to the story without bowing to the discourser at first fall into hell and after undergoing the tortures of hell are reborn as Arjuna trees. </li>' +
'<li>Those who, not being sick, listen to the story lying down, fall into hell and are reborn as pythons etc. </li>' +
'<li>Those who listen to the story seated on the same level as the discourser become as sinful as the defiler of the preceptor\'s bed and fall into hell. </li>' +
'<li>Those who speak ill of the discourser or of this sacred story are born as dogs and lead miserable lives in hundred births. </li>' +
'<li>Those who begin to argue and dispute while the discourse is being held fall in to hell and after undergoing the tortures there are reborn as donkeys. </li>' +
'<li>Those who never listen to this sanctifying story fall into hell. After experiencing the tortures there they are reborn as wild boars. </li>' +
'<li>The rogues who create hindrances even as the discourse is being held fall into hell. After undergoing the tortures there for millions of years they are reborn as village-boars. </li>' +
'<li>Realising all these, the listener shail always be pure, devoted to the discourser and intelligent enough to listen to the story with devotion. </li>' +
'<li>For warding off ~bstacles to the discourse Lord Ga:r;:tesa should be worshipped at first. Every day at the end of the discourse he shall briefly perform expiatory rites (for omissions and commissions). </li>' +
'<li>He shall worship the nine planets<noteref4_note4footer>(4) - (23)</note> and the deities in the "Sarvatobhadra" array. He shall worship the book according to the rites of Siva\'s adoration. </li>' +
'<li>At the conclusion of the worship he shall offer prayer to the book identified directly with Siva, humbly and piously joining his palms in reverence. </li>' +
'<li>(The Prayer)<ul><li> "Thou art the visible Mahesvara Srimat Sivapurana. Thou hast been accepted by me for listening purpose.

Please lift me up from it, miserable wretch that I am, with my limbs caught in by the crocodiles of Karman (Action) : 0 Sankara, I am Thy slave." . </li></ul> The householder shall thus pray to Sivapurana identified directly with Siva, in words evoking pity. Then he shall begin the worship of the discourser. </li>' +
'<li>He shall adore the discourser too in the same manner as in the rite of the worship of Siva and propitiate him with flowers, cloths, ornaments, incense lamps etc. </li>' +
'<li>In the presence of the discourser he shall take vow and observe all restraints with a pure mind and the same shall be maintained till the conclusion to the extent of his capacity. </li>' +
'<li>"0 Thou,· the foremost of discoursers, identified with Vyasa, well-versed in the sacred literature of Siva, please remove my ignorance· through the light of this story." </li>' +
'<li>He shall invite five brahmins (if he can) or at least a brahmin for repeating Siva Pancarna mantra.<noteref5_note5footer>(5) - (24)</note></li>' +

'<li>The devotee who takes up this rite shall take his daily meal only at the end of the daily discourse. He must observe Brahmacarya (celibacy) during those days. He must iie on the ground and take food only in the Patravalli (a number of leaves stitched together· to serve the purpose of a plate).</li>' +
'<li> The man who has the strength in abundance shall observe fast till the conclusion of the whole Purana and listen to the excellent Sivapurana with great devotion and purity. </li>' +
'<li>He may drink only milk or ghee throughout and listen to the story with pleasure. He may live on fruit diet or take a single meal or even eschew that and proceed with the listening rite. ·</li>' +

'<li>The householder taking the rite shall avoid heavy indigestible pulses like Nispava, Masiirika etc., stale food, defiled food, brinjals, gourds, radish, pumpkins, coconuts, garlic, onion, asafoetida, intoxicating beverages and all kinds of meat. </li>' +
'<li>He shall avoid the six base feelings of lust, anger etc., he shall not despise brahmins and bear ill will towards chaste ladies and good men. </li>' +
'<li>He shall not look at women in their menstrual period. He shall not converse with fallen people, nor talk to haters of brahmins or unbelievers in the Vedas. </li>' +
'<li>The house-holder shall practise and strictly adhere to truthfulness, purity, mercy, restraint in speech, straightforwardness, humility, liberalmindedness and other virtues. </li>' +
'<li>The householder may listen ,to the story with any specific desire cherished in his mind or absolutely free from any desire. If he has any desire it will be fulfilled; if he is free from desire he shall attain salvation. </li>' +

'<li>The listener shall gradually become detached and especially on the next day, 0 sage, the ·holy Gita narrated by Siva to Ramacandra must be read. </li>' +
'<li>If the listener is a householder he must perform Homa with pure Havis (holy ghee) for tranquilising the rite. </li>' +
'<li>The Homa must be performed with Rudrasamhita or with each verse of Gayatri, for in fact, this Purana is identical with it, </li>' +
'<li>or with the Miilamantra of Siva of five syllables. If he is incompetent to perform Homa let him give the gheeo:ffering to a brahmin. </li>' +

'<li>If he is competent, 0 sage, he must make an image of a lion with three Palas of gold and either engrave the name of this Puranaa on it or affix a label with the name written on it.

Devaki and Vasudeva became aware of these happenings, but they were afraid to inform Kamsa, lest in his vindictive frenzy, he might hack the womb to pieces.

Such yearning can arise in the mind only due to good deeds performed in the previous lives.

Just then, there was an effulgent Form with a strange splendor standing before her. Gradually, the Form became clear! It was armed with the Conch, the Discus and the Mace; the fourth hand was held in Abhaya pose. It said softly and sweetly, “Do not fear! I am Narayana. I am to be born in a few minutes as your son in an answer to the promise I made as a result of your earnest prayers. I will be known as Krishna and also as Vasudeva. As soon as I am born, the shackles will fall off from your hands and feet. The doors of the prison will open by themselves.

I shall arrange it so.” Blessing Devaki and Vasudeva, the effulgent Form entered the womb of Devaki as an Orb of Light. Within minutes the Divine Child was born! It was 3:30AM. The shackles that bound the hands and feet of Vasudeva fell off in a trice. The doors and the gates flew open. Though it was still dark, a cuckoo was cooing with a sudden spurt of joy. The Rain-God was showering flower drops of rain on the earth. Around the prison, flocks of bird clustered in happy song, twittering sweet melody.

                content: '<p>Vasudeva did not delay. He spread an old dhoti on a bamboo basket and placed the Babe on it. He tore an old sari of Devaki and covered the Babe and placed the basket on his head. He moved out of the open doors and gates, past the sleeping guards. He noticed the little drops of rain that was falling on the Babe and was afraid that the Babe would be soaked. But, when he turned back, he found a snake following his footsteps, holding the ribbed umbrella of its broad hoods over the child preventing the rain from wetting the Babe. He soon realized that it was Adisesha protecting the Lord. Though the sun had not risen yet, the lotus bloomed in all the tanks and leaned on its stalk towards the Babe. Though it was a dark night, with a deep yearning to look at the Babe, the full moon peeped through the clouds, with its cool rays illuminating the entire route to Gokul. Vasudeva began to cross Yamuna river to reach Gokul. The water was rising very rapidly above Vasudeva’s head and he was afraid that he would drown. It dawned on him that Yamuna was paying its respects to the Lord by wetting the feet of the Babe! The Babe was placed next to Yashoda and the baby girl that had just been born there was brought and placed into the hands of Devaki. No sooner this was done, Vasudeva burst into tears! While these words were coming from Suka’s lips, Parikshith exclaimed aloud, “Krishna, Krishna!” Everyone looked at the King. They saw a snake crawling away fast, after biting the right toe of the King. Suka shed tears of Bliss; He announced, “The King has merged with the Lord”. The word Suka means parrot. Yes, he was the parrot that plucked the ripe nectar filled fruit called Bhagavatha from the tree of the Vedas and enabled the world to taste it. May the world relish the fruit and derive the Atmic Bliss!</p>'
