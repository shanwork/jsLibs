Five lakh and forty thousand numbers of Indras succeed one after another during the whole life span of Brahma.<br/> A Vishnu day is equivalent to the whole life span of Brahma. The whole life span of Vishnu is equivalent to a day of \'Rudra\'.<br/> The whole life span of Rudra is equivalent to a day of lord Shiva.

'<p>The whole Pashupat Vrata is divided into five parts - Kriya, Taipei, Tapa, Dhyana and Gyan. The Shaiva-dharma is the supreme religion and the rituals pertaining to it are based on the Shruits and the Smritis. Pashupat Vrata has been mentioned in the Vedas as the bestower of Supreme knowledge. It also contains all the eight organs of yoga, which were created by lord Shiva himself. Lord Shiva is easily pleased if worship is done by this method. The devotee attains supreme knowledge and becomes liberated from all the bondages of this world. </p>' +
'<p>Pashupat Vrata has been mentioned even in the Atharvasheersha Upanishad. It begins on the full moon day, in the month of Chaitra. It can be performed anywhere - a Shiva temple, any sacred place of pilgrimage, forest or garden.</p>' +
'<p>A devotee should get up early in the morning, on the thirteenth day of bright lunar phase (two days preceding the full moon day) and after finishing his daily duties he should make salutations to his Guru. With the permission of his guru, the devotee should then put on while coloured clothes and a sacred thread of the same colour. He should also wear a white garland around his neck and apply sandal wood paste on his body. He should then sit on the seat made of Kusha grass and take a vow by holding a Kusha grass in his hand. After this he should do Havana by offerings articles into the sacred fire. He should observe a fast for the whole day and break it only in the night by having \'Prasada\'.</p>' +
'<p>This ritual should be repeated on the following day but the fast should not be broken in the night. On the final day, that is full moon day he should repeat all the rituals and after putting off the fire of the Havana Kunda, he should smear his body with the ashes. He should then take his bath and put on dear\'s skin or bark of the tree. He should also hold a stick and put on a waist band (Mekhala). After that he should again rinse (Achaman) his mouth and smear ashes on his body. He should perform the exercise of Ashtanga yoga. Three times in a day as per the instructions of his guru. This way a man is freed from the beastly qualities present in him.</p>' +
'<p>Pashupat Vrata can be performed by a devotee as long as he is alive or he can continue it for twelve years of three years or one year or six months or one month, or twelve days or three days or even one day. On the completion of Pashupat Vrata, a devotee should establish a Shiva idol and worship it with all the sixteen modes of worship. At last he should perform Awaran Pujan and then worship his guru. Through out the period of fast, a devotee should have fruits only and he should sleep on the bare land. Pashupat Vrata done in such a way helps a devotee to attain to the abode of lord Shiva.  </p>' ,

content: '<p>Vayudeva told the sages who had assembled at Naimisharanya that goddess Gauri was the manifestation of Shiva\'s power and Shankar the omnipotent almighty. Both Shiva and goddess Shiva contain fathomless splendours of which only a fraction is visible in this world. This world is under the control of Shiva and goddess Shiva. Both of them are inseparable. Just as the light of the sun can not exist without the Sun in the same way goddess Shiva can not exist without lord Shiva. Just as a lifeless body is of no use similarly the world can not exist without goddess Shakti. </p>' +
'<p>This illusionary world is tied up with the delusionary ropes of Shiva and Shakti. The whole creation is the appearance of Almighty Shiva. The ignorant sages describe it in different ways according to their own perceptions. But, the fact is that Shiva is one and this world is the creation of his illusions. A man can attain liberation from this illusionary world only when he has the blessings of Shiva. </p>' +
'<p>Lord Shiva is beyond the reach of lust, attachment and pleasures. His existence is separate from the nature, delusion, intelligence and ego. He is free from all the bondages.</p>' ,

'<p>After becoming liberated from these flaws a man can easily attain six types of accomplishment - talent (Pratibha), super power of hearing (Shravana), excellent conversational power and power of speech (Vrata), Divine sight (Darshan), Divine power of taste (Aswad), Divine power of touch (Vedana). The capability of seeing things situated at distant places is called \'Pratibha\'. The ability to listen without making any effort is called \'Shravana\'. The ability to decipher the meaning of animal\'s language is called \'Vrata\'. Being able to see divine things without making any effort is called \'Darshan\'. The power, which enables a man to know about the taste of a thing without actually tasting it, is called \'Aswad\'. \'Vedana\' means the knowledge of all types of touch.</p>' +
'<p>A devotee can attain all types of accomplishment merely by having devotion towards lord Shiva and by meditating on him. In the beginning, a yogi should try to meditate on the form of Shiva (Saguna), but later on the switch over to Shiva\'s formless (nirguna) quality. Meditating on nirguna form of Shiva is not easy. It can be mastered only by constant and steady practice. When mastered it bestows all kinds of accomplishment. Meditation combined with Pranayama gives four types of accomplishments peace (Shanti), tranquility (Prashanti), luster (Dipti) and boon (Prasad). A devotee can have a darshan of lord Shiva if he does meditation with non attachment</p>' ,

content: '<p>The sages thanked Vayudeva for giving the knowledge of Jnana Yoga. The next day, they took bath in river Saraswati and performed their worship and rituals. After that they proceeded towards Kashi. At Kashi after taking their bath in river Ganga they had a darshan of lord Vishwanath. They saw very radiant effulgence appearing in the sky, in which they saw thousand sages who had accomplished Pashupat Vrata getting merged. The radiant effulgence vanished in no time.  </p>' +
'<p>The sages were very curious to know about that radiant effulgence, so they went to lord Brahma and asked him about it. Lord Brahma told them that the radiant effulgence had actually instructed them to accomplish Pashupat Vrata and attain Salvation. Lord Brahma then instructed them to go to the Sumeru mountain where Nandi was supposed to come and teach the methods of doing Pashupat Vrata to Sanatkumar.</p>' +
'<p>Once Sanatkumar became very arrogant of his asceticism. One day lord Shiva arrived at his place but Sanatkumar did not get up to greet him. At this Nandi became furious and cursed him to become a camel. Sanatkumar got transformed into a camel. Lord Brahma worshipped Shiva to liberate his son- Sanatkumar from the curse. Lord Shiva became pleased and blessed Sanatkumar, as the result of which he regained his human body.</p>' +
'<p>After regaining his human body Sanatkumar commenced a tremendous penance. Lord Shiva instructed Nandi to go to Sumeru mountain and preach Sanatkumar.  </p>' +
'<p>The sages reached Sumeru mountain as per the instruction of lord Brahma. They saw many sages meditating at the bank of a pond. They also saw Sanatkumar engrossed in his meditation at a little distance from the other meditating sages.  </p>' +
'<p>The sages went near Sanatkumar and told him about their penances done for ten thousand years. They also revealed to him about the purpose of their arrival. Right then, Nandi arrived there, accompanied by his ganas Sanatkumar and all the sages welcomed him. Sanatkumar introduced all the sages to Nandi and told him about their tremendous penance done for ten thousand years. Nandi became very pleased and blessed them. He then preached Sanatkumar and all the sages on the Shiva tattva.</p>' +
'<p>Sanatkumar passed on that knowledge to Sage Vyasa, who again passed it on to Suta. Suta then revealed this knowledge to those sages who had assembled at Prayag. After receiving that knowledge from Suta all the sages went to Prayaga tirtha and took their bath. As they saw the signs of approaching Kali Yuga, they went to Kashi and performed the Pashupat Vrata. All of them attained liberation with the blessings of Lord Vishnu.</p>' +
'<p>Listening to Shiva Purana for one time liberates a man from all of his sins. Listening to it for two times helps him to develop devotion in lord Shiva. Listening to Shiva Purana for three times, helps a man to attain to the abode of Shiva</p>' ,
