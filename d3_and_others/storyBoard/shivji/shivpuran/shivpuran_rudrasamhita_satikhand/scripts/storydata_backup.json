<ol><li>0 Brahma, thanks to Siva's favour, you know everything. You have narrated to me the wonderful stories of Siva and Parvati.</li>
<li>0 lord, I am never fully satiated by hearing the great story of Siva from your lotus-like face. I wish to hear further the same.</li>
<li>As explained by you, Rudra is the complete manifestation of Siva. He is the great Lord whose abode is Kailasa. He is a yogin of perfect control. 
He is worthy of being propitiated by all devas, and ·others. He is the final goal of all good men. 
He is free from Dvandvas (mutually clashing opposites). The great lord never undergoes any change yet indulges in His divine sports.. 
He became a· householder again after marrying the noble lady Mangala at the request of when she performed penance. 
At first she was born of and later of Himalaya. How could she be the daughter of both with the same body? How did Sati<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (233)</note> become Parvati and attain Siva again?

<li>0 best of sages, dear one, listen. I shall narrate the auspicious story on· hearing which undoubtedly the life will become fruitful.</li>
<li>Formerly, on seeing my daughter Sandhya<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (234)</note> in the company of my sons I was afflicted by the arrows of the cupid and much upset.</li>
<li>When remembered by Dharma, Rudra, the highest lord and the greatest yogin came there. He reproached me as well as my sons and went back to His abode.</li>
<li>A serious offence was committed by me against Siva the great lord, by whose Maya I was subjected to great delusion despite my being the reciter of the Vedas.</li>
<li>Under great delusion and goaded by the envious feelings towards the lord I conspired with my sons to find out ways and means to delude the lord Himself. Here again I was deluded by Siva's Maya.</li>
<li>0 great sage, in Siva the great lord, all those ways and means pursued by me and my sons became in- effective.</li>
<li>When my strategy failed I remembered the lord of ( in the company of my sons. The intelligent
lord of Laxmi (Visnu) devoted to Siva came there and advised me.</li>
<li>Instructed by Visnu who demonstrated Siva's
principles, I cast off my envy no doubt, but since I still was· under delusion I did not eschew my stubbornness.</li>
<li>I humbly served Sakti and when she was pleased I created her as the daughter of and Asikni ( 's wife) . you remember, .was my son. This was my endeavour to make Hara enamoured of her.
</li>
<li>The goddess Uma became daughter, performed a severe penance and thanks to her great devotion became Rudra's wife. The goddess indeed is a benefactress of her devotees.</li>
<li>In the company of Uma, Rudra became a householder and the great lord performed divine sports. He of undecaying intellect deluded me even at the time of his marriage.</li>
<li>The independent lord assuming his own body married her and returned to his mountain. In her company he sported much, deluding many.</li>
<li>0 sage, much time was happily spent by Siva free from all depraved feelings and indulging in noble dalliance with her.</li>
<li>Then a feeling of rivalry arose between Daksa and Rudra; was excessively deluded by Siva's illusion and so becoming extremly haughty he censured the quiet Siva who was free from all depraved feelings.</li>
<li>Then the haughty, performed a sacrifice without Siva, although he had invited me and all other devas.</li>
<li>Since he was in delusion he was very furious. So he did not invite Rudra and his own daughter Sati. He was greatly deluded by his own fate.</li>
<li>When she was not invited by her father whose· mind was deluded by illusion, Siva ( Sati) of perfect knowledge and purest chastity played a divine sport.</li>
<li>Though not invited by her haughty father she did go to her father's house securing the reluctant permission of Siva.</li>
<li>Seeing no share of Rudra set apart and being slighted by her father, she all those who were present there and cast off her body.</li>
<li>On hearing that, lord Siva became unbearably furious and pulling at his matted hair he created Virabhadra.<noteref3_note3footer>(3) - (235)</note></li>
<li>When he was created along with attendants he began asking "What shall I do?". The entire annihilation of sacrifice and the disgrace of every one present
there was the order issued by Siva.</li>
<li>The lord of the Gal).as (Virabhadra) accompanied by his soldiers reached the place immediately after receiving the orders.</li>
<li>They worked a great havoc there. Virabhadra chastised everyone and spared none.</li>
<li>After defeating and the Devas with strenuc:>us effort, the chief of Ganas cut off the head of and consigned it to the sacrificial fire.</li>
<li>Working great havoc he destroyed the sacrifice. Then he came back to the mountain and bowed to Lord Siva.</li>
<li>Even as the whole of the world of Devas was witnessing, the process of destruction of the sacrifice was carried out by Virabhadra and others, the followers of Rudra.</li>
<li>The policy in agreement with what is laid down in the Vedas and Smrtis is this, 0 Sage, which you must note. When lord Rudra is angry, how can there be happiness in the world ?</li>
<li>On hearing his song of praise Rudra relented. Favourably disposed to the miserable that he was, he granted their request.</li>
<li>Siva, the great lord, indulging in different sorts of divine sports, became sympathetic and merciful as before.</li>
<li>Daksa was resuscitated. The whole sacrifice was renewed under the instruction of the merciful Lord Siva. All those present were honoured in due manner.</li>
<li>0 sage, in that sacrifice Rudra was honoured by all the Gods with due devotion. They were highly delighted.</li>
<li>The flame of fire arising from the body of Sati and delighting the whole world fell on that mountain and it was duly worshipped.</li>
<li>The deity became famous as Jvaliimukhi yielding fruits of cherished desires. Even her very vision quells all sins.</li>
<li>Even now she is worshipped with due festivities for the acquisition of all desires, observing all stipulated modes of procedure.</li>
<li>The Goddess Sati became the daughter of Himalaya. As such she became famous as Parvati.</li>
<li>She propitiated lord Siva with a rigorous penance and attained him as her husband.</li>
<li>0 great sage, I have narrated to you all that you asked me. Whoever hears this narrative will no doubt be freed from all sins.</li>

`233. Sati, the daughter of the son of Brahma, was married to Siva. She abandoned her body in consequence of the quarrel between her husband and father. It is said in the Purar;tas that Daksa instituted a sacrifice but apportioned no share to Siva. Thereupon Sati 'felt insulted
and entered the sacrificial fire whereupon Siva sent hundreds and thousands of powerful Gar;tas who destroyed the sacrifice and beheaded The :gresent section narrates the story of the birth of Sati, her marriage with Siva, their lovely sports and her tragic end at the sacrifice of her father, Daksa.`,
`234.Sandhya 'lit. twilight' is personified as the .daughter .. of Brahma. It is said tliat Brahma attempted to do violence to her but was reproached by Siva. According to another version Sandhya changed herself to a deer for escape from the evil intention of Brahma whereupon Brahma assumed the form of a stag and pursued her through the sky. Siva saw this and shot an arrow which cut off the head of the·stag. Brahma ·then reassumed his own form and paid homage to Siva,`,
`235.Virabhadra is described as son, produced from Siva's

                <li>0 sage, listen to the auspicious glory of Sati and Siva entirely. It is extremely sanctifying, divine and the greatest secret of all secrets.</li>
                <li>0 sage, Siva himself narrated this formerly to Visnu, the greatest of devotees for helping others, when
                requested by him.</li>
                <li>the intelligent and the greatest of Siva's
                devotees was asked by me and 0 great sage, he told me everything lovingly.</li>
                <li>Therefore I shall narrate this ancient story that confers the fulfilment of all desires since it glorifies·Sati and Siva.</li>
                <li>Originally when Siva was separated from Sakti and was pure consciousness alone, He was attributeless, free from alternatives, devoid of forms and beyond the
                existent and non-existent.</li>
                <li>He, the greatest of the great and of changeless
                form when united with Sakti, was filled with attributes and had specific forms and divine features. 0 brahmin, He was accompanied by Uma.</li>
                <li>Visnu was born of His left and I, Brahma, of his right side, 0 great sage, Rudra was born of his heart.</li>
                <li>I became the creator (Brahma); Visnu the cause of sustenance; Rudra the author of dissolution. Thus Sadasiva, manifested himself in three forms.</li>
                <li>It was after worshipping Him that I, Brahma, the grand-father of all the worlds, began the creation of all subjects including Devas, Asuras, human beings etc.</li>
                <li>After creating the guardians of the subjects, Prajapatis, and other Devas, I considered myself loftier
                than others and was delighted.</li>
                <li>0 sage, when I created Marici, Atri, Pulaha,
                Pulastya, Angiras, Kratu, Narada, and Bhrgu, my mental sons of lordly stature, a beautiful woman of handsome features was born of my mind.</li>
                <li>She was variously called Sandhya, Divaksanta, 
                Sayamh Sandhya and Jayantika. She was very beautiful with finely-shaped eyebrows capable of captivating the minds of ·even sages.</li>
                <li>Neither in human world nor in that of the Devas was there such a woman of complete perfection in all qualities. Nor was there such a woman in nether worlds in all the three times (past; present and future).</li>
                <li>On seeing her I involuntarily got up. Various thoughts rose up in my heart. and others-the Prajapatis, Marici and -others-all my sons, felt similarly.</li>
                <li>0 best of sages, when I Brahma, thought like this, a wonderfully Beautiful Being appeared as my mental creation.</li>
                <li>He had a golden complexion. His chest was stout and firm. His nose was fine. His thigh, hips and calves were round and plump. He had blue wavelets of hair. His eyebrows were thickset and tremulous. His face
                shone like the full moon. His hairy chest was broad like a door. He was as huge as the celestial elephant Airavata. He was wearing a blue cloth. His hands, eyes, face, legs and fingers were red in colour. He had a slender waist. His teeth were fine. He smelt like an elephant in its rut. His eyes were like the petals of a full-bown lotus. He was fragrant like the filaments. His neck was like the conch. He bad the emblem of a fish. He was tall. He had the Makara fish for his vehicle. He was armed with a bow and five flowers for his arrows. His loving glance was very attractive as he rolled his eyes here and there. 0 dear one, his very breath was a fragrant wind. He was accompanied by the sentiment of love.</li>
                <li>On seeing that Being, my sons, and others, were struck with wonder and became eager and inquisitive.</li>
                <li>Their mind became deformed and confused imme- diately. Smitten with love they lost their mental courage.</li>
                <li>On seeing me the creator and the lord of the worlds, the person bowed down with his shoulders stooping by humility and said.</li>

                <li>Taking his five flower-arrows, Kama decided on his future course remaining invisible in form.</li>
                <li>His five arrows are respectively <ul><li>Harsana (delighting)</li><li>Rocana (appealing)</li><li> Mohana (deluding)</li><li>Sosana (withering) and</li><li>Maran.a (killing)</li></ul>. Even sages could be deluded and tormented by them.</li>
                <li>(Kama thought like this.:-) I shall make a beginning of my career as assigned by Brahma himself as my eternal task, here itself in the presence of the sages and Braluna. All the sages and Brahma are present here. They shall witness my resolution and performance. Sandhya
                who was referred to by Brahma is also present here. She shall be my mouth-piece. I shall test my power here and
                then only carry on my work elsewhere.</li>
                <li>After thinking like this and deciding on his further activity, Kama fitted his flower-arrows.</li>
                <li>Kama, the foremost of archers, stood steady in the posture of Alidha (the posture for shooting, the right knee advanced and the left leg retracted), bent his bow almost into a circle and was ready to shoot.</li>
                <li>0 excellent sage, when the bow was kept ready by him, fragrant winds delighting everyone blew there.</li>
                <li>The enchanter then charmed Brahma and others, the mental sons with several sharp flower-arrows.</li>
                <li>0 sage, the sages and I were thus enamoured and we felt very great change in our mental feelings.</li>
                <li>We began to stare at Sandhya frequently, passion depraving our minds. Our lust was heightened. Truly a woman is one who increases passionate feelings.</li>
                <li>Making all of us thoroughly enchanted thus, he did not stop till all of us lost control over our sense-organs.</li>
                <li>When on seeing her, my vital elements became displaced, fortynine animal instincts Bhavas came, out of my body.</li>
                <li>She too began to manifest the instinctive gestures of side-glances, pretences of concealing feelings etc. as a result of being hit by Kama's arrows when she was being stared at by them.</li>
                <li>Profusely exhibiting these emotions, the naturally beautiful Sandhya shone brilliantly like the celestial river producing gentle ripples.</li>
                <li>0 sage, on seeing her emotionally excited I loved her all the more despite the fact that I was the creator and my body was filled with Dharmic features.</li>
                <li>All the sages, Marici, Atri, and others, b foremost among brahmins, attained the state of sensuous excitement.</li>
                <li>Seeing me as well as Marici and others in such a situation and seeing Sandhya engaged in her affairs, Madana continued to concentrate his attention on his activity.</li>
                <li>"The work entrusted to me by :Brahma can easily be performed by me" so thought Kama justifiably.</li>
                <li>On seeing the sinful proclivities of his brothers and father, Dharma remembered Lord Siva, the lord protector of virtue.</li>
                <li>Mentally meditating on Siva, the protector of virtue, Dharma, the son of Brahma eulogised Siva with different prayers in his state of sorrow.

                <li>On hearing these words of Siva, I, the lord of the world, perspired profusely in an instant, on account of shame..</li>
                <li>Although the desire to seize Sandhya of wishful features still lingered, 0 sage, I curbed the upset senses, fearing him (Siva)..</li>
                <li>0 excellent brahmin, from the drops of sweat that fell from my body rose the manes who did not perform the sacrifices while they were living on earth, who shone like split collyrium, had eyes resembling the full-bown lotus, were meritorious ascetics and were av:erse to worldly activities. .</li>
                <li>These were sixty-four thousand in number, 0 sage,and the manes called Bahrisads lit. seated on grass, were eighty-six thousand.</li>
                <li>From the drops of sweat that fell from body, a splendid woman endowed with good qualities was born.</li>
                <li>She was of slender body with symmetrical hips. Her waist was well-shaped; small curly hairs embellished it. She was soft in body with fine teeth. She had a shining golden complexion. In her body, she was perfect. Her face shone like the full moon and full-blown lotus. Her name was Rati. She was capable of captivating even the sages.</li>
                <li>Excepting Kratu, Pulastya and Angiras, the six viz. Marici and others successfully curbed their senses and their activities.</li>
                <li>0 excellent sage, the semen virile of the four-Kratu and others-fell on the ground from which other types of manes were born.</li>
                <li>They were Somapas, .Ajyapas, Kalins and Havismantas They are all termed Kavyavahas also. They are their sons.</li>
                <li>The Somapas are the sons of Kratu, Kalins of Ajyapas of Pulastya and of Arigiras. </li>
                <li>0 excellent brahmin, when the manes and others were born, they were assigned the task of Kavya- vahas (taking the oblations and offering) among the manes.</li>
                <li>Sandhya who thus became the mother of the Pitrs served the same purpose as theirs. Since she has been glanced at kindly by Siva she became free from defects and devoted herself to virtuous rites.</li>
                <li>In the meantime after blessing all the brahmins and protecting virtue duly Siva vanished suddenly.</li>
                <li>I, the grandfather of the world, snubbed and put to shame by Siva's words, turned my anger against Kama with a frowning face and knit eyebrows.</li>
                <li>0 sage, seeing my face ·and realising my hint, Kama withdrew his arrows. He was so terribly afraid of Siva.</li>
                <li>0 sage, then I, the lotus-born, became very futious like the strong blazing fire· seeking to consume··every·· thing.</li>
                <li>I, Brahma, then said :- "After playing this same trick on Siva, Kama will be consumed -in the fire of Siva's eye and freed of his arrogance." 0 excellent brahmin, it was in the presence of the manes and the sages of perfect control that I spoke to Kama in this way.</li>
                <li>On hearing this curse of terrible nature, Rati's husband was frightened. He abandoned his arrows and became visible.</li>
                <li>0 sage, he spoke to me (i.e. Brahma) and my sons and others even as the Pitrs and Sandhya stood there listening. By this time his arrogance had disappeared.</li>
                <li>Kama said : - " 0 Brahma, why have I been so terribly cursed by you? 0 lord of worlds, I have not committed any sin against you who are reputed to follow justi- ciable path.</li>
                <li>0 Brahma, you have assigned me my task. I have only carried it out. Hence this curse is not proper. I have not done anything else.</li>
                <li>You had said :-"All of us, I, and Siva are targets of your arrows." I only tested your statement.</li>
                <li>I am not guilty in this respect. 0 Brahma I being innocent, this conditional curse, 0 lord of universe, is very terrible. /</li>
                <li>On hearing his words, I, Brahma, the lord of the universe, replied to Madana who had controlled himself, trying to suppress him further.</li>
                <li>I cursed you because you have aimed at us-this Sandhya who is my daughter and me her father.</li>
                <li>But now I am free from anger. In this state I tell you 0 KamaJ do not be under any suspicion. Listen. Cast off your fear. Be happy.</li>
                <li>0 Kama,. he will reduce you to ashes in the fire of his eye. But he will give you another ·similar body. after-· wards.</li>
                <li>When Siva takes to a wife He Himself will get you another body.</li>
                <li>After speaking thus to Kama, I the grandfather of the world, vanished from there even as the sages, my mental sons, were watching.</li>
                <li>On hearing these words of mine, Kama and the mental sons of mine became happy and returned quickly to their abodes.</li>

                <li>Kama looked at her thighs lovely like the stump of a plantain as though they were his javelin.</li>
                <li>The heels, the tips and the sides of her feet W¢fe reddish in tinge. With them she looked as the comrade of the Cupid.</li>
                <li>Her red hands with nails like Ki:rhsuka flowers and with well-rounded tapering fingers were very beautiful.</li>
                <li>Her arms were fine like the lotus-stalk. They were glossy and soft. They resembled corals putting forth beams of splendour.</li>
                <li>Her glossy hair resembled the ·blue cloud and the fluffy tail of the Camari dear. Thus shone the wife of Kama.</li>
                <li>Just as Lord Siva accepted Ganga oozing from the snowy mountain, Kama married her. She carried a discus and a lotus in her hand. She had arms fine as the lotusMstalk. She had wavelets of her eyebows. Her side- glances rose up and down like gentle tides. She had eyes resembling a blue lotus. The curly locks of hair on her body were like the mossy growth in the river. She shone with her mind expanded like the tree. Her deep navel resembled the deep eddy. Thus shone Rati with her beautiful body. In
                fact she appeared to be the abode of beauty itself like Ramaa ( Goddess Laxmi).</li>
                <li>She had twelve varieties of ornaments. She was an expert in the sixteen types of amorous gestures. She was capable of charming the whole world. She illuminated all the ten quarters.</li>
                <li>Seeing Rati like this, Kama eagerly accepted her just as Visnu accepted Laxmi who approached him with love.</li>
                <li>In his height of joy, the deluded Kama forgot the terrible curse of Brahma and so he had no occasion to mention about it to Daksa</li>
                <li>Great festivities heightening the pleasure of every- one ensued, 0 dear one. My son was more delighted than everyone else. He rejoiced.</li>
                <li>Having reached the acme of happiness Kama thought all miseries were at an end. Dak$a's daughter Rati was highly delighted on getting Kama as 'her husband. The
                sweet-voiced Kama rejoiced with her like the cloud at sunset mingled with sparkling lightning. Thus Kama took Rati  to his chest in his happy delusion like the Yogin his :\ knowledge. Having secured a fine husband, Rati with face
                shining like the full moon shone like Laxmi having secured Hari.</li>

                <li>Formerly on seeing Sandhya, my daughter, I cherished a love for her, which, being afraid of Siva, I forsook.</li>
                <li>Sandhya's mind too was shaken on being stirred by. Kama's arrows. The same had happened with the mind of the noble-souled sages who had so far curbed their minds.
                </li>
                <li>She had heard the words of Siva to me couched in mocking terms. She had realised that her mental aberration in regard to the sages was beyond decency. She had seen the attitude of Kama culminating in the delusion of the sages, frequently. Hence Sandhya was excessively distressed with respect to her marriage.
                </li>
                <li>0 sage, then I cursed Kama. Siva left the place and I too disappeared. Thus her support was lost. So, 0 excellent sage, Sandhya became furious. Then, my daughter considered all these things and meditated.
                </li>
                <li> Meditating on the recent events, she of great fortitude mused what befitted the situation.

                <li>Seeing me as a lady in the prime of my youth even at my nativity, my father, prompted by Kama, cherished a lustful desire for me.</li>
                <li>The minds of the sages, the mental sons, reputed to be pure in mind, on seeing me became lustful breaking the conventions.</li>
                <li>My mind too was excessively stirred up by the wicked Kama, as a result of which; on seeing those sages it too became excessively shaken.
                </li>
                <li> Of. course Kama reaped the fruits of his sinful misdeeds, for Brahma became angry and cursed him in the presence of Siva.</li>
                <li>I too shall have to reap the fruits of my $in. I have commi,tted a great sin. I wish to have a means for making amends.</li>
                <li> Directly perceiving that I too had lustful feelings, the brothers and my father had a similar desire. Hence I am the worst sinner.</li>
                <li>I too had the unconventional lustful feelings on seeing them, towards my own father and brothers as towards a husband.</li>
                <li>I shall perform expiatory rites myself for my sin. Foilowing the Vedic injunctions I shall consign myself to the fire.</li>
                <li>But I shall set up the new limits in the world. No person shall be so lustful at the time of birth.</li>
                <li>For this purpose I ·shall perform a severe penance. Then I shall establish the new limits and afterwards I shall abandon this life.</li>
                <li> No purpose will be served with this body for which love was cherished by my father and brothers.</li>
                <li>This body cannot be the means for achieving merit, for, it was through this body that lustful feelings were generated in my father and brothers.</li>
                <li>Thinking thus in her mind, Sand.hya went to the mountain Candrabhaga from which the river Candrabhaga<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (237)</note> flows.</li>
                <li>On coming to know that she had gone to the mountain, I, Brahma, told my_son the omniscient, of purified mind due to penance, who had acquired spiritual knowledge who was seated near me and who had mastered the Vedas and the Vedangas.
                </li>
                <li>" 0 son approach Sandhya, my daughter of great fortitude. She is desirous of performing a penance. Initiate her duly in the procedure of that.</li>
                <li>0 great sage, formerly seeing you all and me as her lovers and realising her own lustful feelings she had blushed.</li>
                <li>Though not expressed and though not personified, your action then is considered by her as her first death. Now she wishes to put an end to her life.</li>
                <li>Among those who observe limits and conventions she wants to lay down a limitation. The chaste lady has gone to the mountain Candrabhaga for performing the penance.</li>
                <li>She does not know the procedure of performing a penance. 0 dear, see that she realises her desire by means of your instructions.</li>
                <li>0 sage, abandon this form of yours. Disguise yourself and approach her to demonstrate the mode of penance.</li>
                <li>You shall assume another form lest she should be embarrassed as before on seeing your natural form and features".</li>
                <li>0 Narada, was thus ordered by me out of pity. The sage too told me "so be it, and approached Sandhya.</li>
                <li>Vasishta saw the celestial lake full of GaiJas and resembling the Manasa lake. He·saw Sandhya too on its bank.</li>
                <li>With her seated on its bank, the lake, full of splendid lotuses, appeared like the sky in the dusk with the moon rising and the stars twinkling.</li>
                <li>On seeing her there full of noble feelings, the sage eagerly looked at the lake called Brhallohita<noteref2_note1footer>(2) - (238)</note>.</li>
                <li>From the ridges of that big mountain which appeared like a big fort wall, the river Candrabhaga rose and flowed towards the Southern sea. The sage saw that too.</li>
                <li>That river breaks the western wing of the mountain Candrabhaga even as Ganga of the mountain Himalaya and flows towards the sea.</li>
                <li>Seeing Sandhya on the bank of the lake Brhallohita on that mountain Candrabhaga, asked her respectfully.

         <li>I bow to Thee, lord Siva, whose form is like a road to heaven, beyond the path of darkness, and who art calm, pure, changeless incomprehensible through worldly knowledge, self-illuminated and unaltered.

         undecaying, eternal bliss, delighted at the outcome of truth and prosperity and productive of glory.</li>
         <li>Obeisance to Thee whose form can be imagined in the nature of Vidya (Perfect Knowledge), which is different from insentient things, Sattvika in will, that which should be meditated on as the form of Atman, which is the utmost essence and which is the holiest of all sanctifying objects.</li>
         <li>Obeisance to Thee, the Yogin whose Sagul_la form is pure, lovely, bedecked in jewels, as white and clean as camphor and which holds in its hand the desired boon, fearlessness, the trident and the scalp.</li>
         <li>Obeisance to Thee whose forms are the sky, the earth, the quarters, the waters, the fire and the Eternal time.</li>
         <li>Obeisance, obeisance to Siva of unmanifest form from whom unmanifest primordial nature and issued forth as its effect.</li>
         <li>Obeisance, obeisance to Thee who createst this universe tn the form of Brahma, who sustainest it in the form of Vigm and who destroyest it in the form of Rudra.</li>
         <li>Obeisance, obeisance to the sause of causes, to the bestower of divine nectar, wisdom and prosperity; to the best- ower of the prosperity of all other worlds, and the luminous greatest of the great.</li>
         <li>Obeisance to Thee, Siva, beyond whose region no other world exists; from whose umbilical region arose the earth, the quarters, the sun, the moon, the cupid, the devas and the ether.</li>
         <li>Thou art, the greatest. supreme soul. Thou art Siva, the various lores, the pure Brahman, the supreme Brahman and the utmost object of deliberation.</li>

         <li>How can he be described by me, whose forms even Brahma and other Gods or sages of great austerity cannot
        describe.</li>
        <li>0 lord, Thou art attributeless. How can Thy attributes be known to me, a mere woman? Even the Gods including Indra and Asuras do not know it.</li>
        <li>Obeisance to Thee, 0 Lord Siva, obeisance to Thee, 0 personification of penance; 0 Siva, lord of the Gods, be pleased, obeisance be to Thee again and again.</li>

        0 lady Sandhya, listen. Your sin has been reduced to ashes. I have abandoned my anger towards you. By this penance you have become pure.</li>
        <li>0 gentle lady Sandhya, whatever you have asked l grant you entirely. I am delighted by this excellent penance of yours.</li>
        <li>(In all living beings) the first stage shall be in- fancy, the second childhood, the third youth and the fourth stage shall be old age.</li>
        <li>When the third stage in life is reached, the living beings shall become lustful. In some cases it shall be at the end of the second stage.</li>
        <li>This new limitation is imposed by me as a result of your penance. No living being shall be lustful at the time of its-nativity.</li>
        <li>You will attain such a pure chastity as will not be attained by any other woman in the three worlds.</li>
        <li>Excepting your husband whoever looks at you with lustful eyes shall immediately become impotent and weak.</li>
        <li>Your husband shall be one endowed with great fortune, penance and comely features. He shall live for a period ofseven Kalpas along with you.</li>
        <li>Thus I have granted you all the boons requested by you. I shall tell you another incident that transpired in the previous birth.</li>
        <li>That you would cast off your body in the fire has been foretold. I shall tell you the means thereo£ You will certainly carry it out.</li>
        <li>Let that be performed by you at the twelve-year- sacrifice of the sage Medhatithi in the blazing sacrificial fire ere long.
        In the ridge ·of this mountain, on the banks of this river Candrabhaga, ·M.edhatithi is performing a great penance in his hermitage.</li>
        <li>You go there unobserved by the sages. Thanks to my favour, you will become his fire-born daughter.</li>
        <li>If you have chosen in your mind a desirable bride- groom as your husband, you shall think of him while you consign your body into the fire.</li>
        <li>0 Sandhya, while you were performing severe penance-which had lasted for four yugas-in the earlier part of Treta Yuga, after the Krta Yuga had elapsed,
had begotten many chaste daughters who were also duly married.</li>
<li>He gave twenty seven of his daughters to the moon it;t marriage. But the moon had a special liking for only Rohini and he neglected others.</li>
<li>Hence, the moon was cursed by Dakf?a, the redemption being, when he sees the Ether he would find her there. At that time the Gods had come near you but since you were having your mind fixed in me, the Gods in the company of Brahma were not seen by you. The river Candrabhaga arose being created by Brahma for the re- demption of the moon from the curse. It was then that Medhatithi arrived here.</li>
<li>There is none equal to him in penance. There has never been such a person, nor will there ever be one. He has now started the sacrifice of of many great rites.
In that blazing sacrificial fire you shall cast off your body. You are pure now. May your other desires be also fulfilled. '</li>
<li>0 Hermitess, these things have been ordairied by me for my ·own end. 0 fortunate woman, do as I instruct you. Go to the sacrifice of that sage.
<p>
Thus after instructing her for her welfare the lord vanished from the scene.

                 <li>On the earth there may be great Asuras bound by illusion. Some are bound by the illusion of Visnu and others by the illusion of Siva.</li>
                 <li>In regard to Siva who has turned away from the world and who is extremely detached, nothing else except the endeavour of Kama will be effective. There is no doubt about it.</li>
                 <li>After saying this and casting meaningful glances at and other sons, I addressed Kama and Rati with great pleasure.</li>
                 <li>0 Kama, foremost among my sons, you are the bestower of happiness in every respect. Listen to my words with great attention in the company of your wife, 0 son of great filial affection.</li>
                 <li>0 Kama, you shine well with this life-companion of yours. She too shines well with you as her husband.</li>
                 <li>Just as Visnu with and with just as the night with the moon and the moon with the night, so you two mutually illuminate each other and tend your matrimonial life. Hence you will be the banner of the universe, nay the banner of the whole cosmos.</li>
                 <li>0 dear one, you shall enchant Siva for the benefit of the universe so that Siva may be included to take a wife unto Himself.</li>
                 <li>In a secluded or in a crowded place, on mountains or in lakes, wherever Siva goes, you shall follow Him along with your mistress and charm him who has controlled Himself and who is averse to women. Excepting you, there is no one to delude Him.</li>
                 <li>0 Kama, it is only when Siva falls in love that you will get redemption from the course. Hence do what is -good for you.</li>
                 <li>Lord Siva as a noble Being shall save you only when he falls in love and aspires for a wife. Hence with your wife to help you, strive to captivate Siva. Earn the laurels of the universe after charming Him.</li>
                 <li>On hearing these words of mine, who am his father and the lord of the universe, Kama spoke these words to me, the lord of all the worlds.</li>

                     <li>0 celestial sage, on hearing these words, Kama humbly paid homage to me and considering the gravity of the matter spoke to me again.</li>

                     <li>I have already made sufficient efforts in this matter of enchanting Him. The delusion could not be effect- ed. Nor it is going to take place now. Nor will it ever take place.</li>
                     <li>Acting on your directive after giving it the due honour and after visiting my troops I shall go again with all pomp and show.</li>
                     <li>But I am certain that He will not be deluded. 0 Brahma I have fears that He may reduce me to ashes.</li>
                     <li>0 great sage, after saying thus Kama, accompa- nied by Vasanta and Rati started with his troops to the abode of Siva, despite the fear lurking in his mind.</li>
                     
                     ....<br/>
                     <li>Kama employed all his wiles as before. Vasanta too employed various means racking his brain in diverse ways.</li>
                     <li>He used many tactics. His troops too tried their '{ best. But Siva, the Great Soul, was not afflicted the least.</li>
                        <li>Kama then returned to my abode. I had great pride in his troops but now distress and discomfit stood facing me.</li>
                        <li>0 dear, bowing to me with despair and dejection while standing before me without pride and arrogance, along with his troops and Vasanta, Kama spoke to me in these words.</li>
                        <li>0 Brahma, more efforts were put by us to enthral Him, but they all went in vain as He was absorbed in deep meditation.</li>
                        <li>There my body was not reduced to ashes because He  is ·merciful. My previous merits too may have been the cause. As for the lord there is no affectation or change in
                        Him.</li>
                        <li>0 Brahmi, if you desire that Siva should take a
                        wife unto Himself, you should employ some means with modesty. This is what I think proper in the circumstances.

                     <li>On 5eeing him in that form I eulogised him again with devotion and words choked with tears. I considered him as my sole refuge.</li>

                     <li>Induced by that I resolved on committing the sin. Please listen. At your bidding I shall narrate it in detail.</li>
                     <li>At the beginning of the creation ten sons were born to me together with a very beautiful daughter originating from my speech.2</li>

                     <li>He rebuked us considering Himself the sole lord, possessed of supreme knowledge and adept in Yogic practices and an enjoyer with full cqntrol over all sense-organs.</li>
                     <li>0 Visnu, my sorrow is that even after manifesting Himself as my son He reproached me face to face. ·I have mentioned it to you now.</li>

                     <li>0 Brahma listen to my words in full. It will eradi- cate your frustration. It will be consistent with what is said in the Vedas and Agamas and what is in conformity with reality.</li>
                     <li>0 Brahma, how is it that you became so utterly confused in the mind? It is improper for the reciter of the
                     Vedas and the creator of the universe to be so wicked.</li>
                     <li>0 slow-witted one, cast-off this sluggishness. Do not indulge in such foolish thoughts hereafter. What is it that the Vedas say by means of their hymns? Think on it with a
                     pure mind.</li>
                     <li>You foolishly think of Rudra, the great lord as your son. 0 Brahman, though the reciter of the Vedas you have forgotten all true knowledge.</li>
                     <li>Considering Siva on a par with ordinary Gods you are maliciously disposed towards Him. Your good intents have vanished and evil ones have cropped up.</li>
                     <li>Listen to the first principle that had been narrated of old. Have clean conscience. It is the true Being that is glorified as the cause of all Creation. This is decisive.</li>
                     <li>Siva is the creator of everything, the sustainer and destroyer. He is greater than the great. He is the supreme Brahman, the greatest lord, the attributeless, the eternal.</li>
                     <li>He cannot be defined. He is not subject to deterioration or decay. He is the supreme soul, without a seco;i.d, unswerving and endless. He is the cause ofdissolution,
                     all-pervasive and great lord.</li>
                     <li>He is all-pervasive, possessed of three gul).as, for the
                     causation of creation, sustenance and dissolution in the name of Brahma, and Mahesa but really beyond Rajas, Sattva and Tamas-the three attributes.</li>
                     <li>He is distinct from illusion. He is free from desires. He is the creator of illusion yet uninfluenced by illusion. He is an adept. He is possessed of attributes yet
                     independent of them. He is blissful in Himself. He is free from suspicions and alternatives.</li>
                     <li>He rests and relaxes in His own soul. He is free from the pair of opposites, such as happiness and unhappiness. He is subservient to His devotees in a fine physical body. He is a yogin devoted always to the practice of Yogas. He is guide to the path of Yoga.</li>
                     <li>He is the lord of the worlds and the destroyer of arrogance. He is favourably disposed to the miserable. Such is the lord, our master whom you consider your son!</li>
                     <li>TCast-off all these stupid notions. Seek refuge in Him. Worship Him exclusively. When He is propitiated He will bestow on you all that is auspicious and beneficent.</li>
                     <li>0 Brahma, if a thought surges in your heart that Siva should take a wife unto Himself, you must perform penance directed to Siva and think upon Siva.</li>
                     <li>Meditate upon Siva with that desire cherished in your heart. If that Goddess is propitiated she will do everything.</li>
                     <li>If Siva takes an incarnation as a human being in Her attributive aspect, as the daughter of a person in the world, She will definitely become His wife.</li>
                     <li>0 Brahma, command Daksha - Let him carry out a penance strenuously with a great devotion to beget her to
                     be given as a wife unto Siva.</li>
                     <li>0 dear, Siva and Siva are subservient to their
                     devotees. This must be realised. Both of them being intrin- sically the supreme Brahman can readily assume attributive form out of their own free will.</li>

                         <li>0 Brahmin, best of my sons, listen attentively to what I did when the lord went away.</li>
                         <li>I began a continuous laudatory prayer of the Goddess Durga, the beloved of Siva, the creator of the universe, of the nature of Vidya and Avidya<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (251)</note> and identical with the pure supreme Brahman.</li>
                         <li>I salute the Goddess who is eternal, for whom there is no support, who is never distressed, who is the mother of the three deities, who is the grossest of the
                         gross and yet has no form.</li>
                         <li>0 Goddess of the devas, you are Perfect knowledge,
                         Supreme Bliss, identical with the supreme Soul. Be pleased. Grant me the fulfilment of my task. Obeisance to you.</li>
                         <li>0 celestial sage, on being thus lauded Chandika, the mystic slumber, appeared before m.e.</li>
                         <li>Her complexion had the glossy hue of collyrium. She had comely features. She had four divine arms. She was seated on a lion. She showed the mystic gesture of granting. boons by one of her hands, and pearls adorned her dishevelled hair.</li>
                         <li>Her face shone like the autumnal moon, the crescent moon bedecked her forehead. She had three eyes, looked beautiful and the nails of her lotus..like feet glistened.</li>
                         <li>0 sage, seeing her who was Siva's Energy herself, directly in front of me, my lofty shoulders bent down with devotion and I eulogised her after due obeisance.</li>
                         <li>Obeisance, obeisence, to Thee, who art in the form of Pravrtti (Action) and Nivrtti (Abstinence); who art in the form of creation and sustenance of the universe. Thou art the eternal Energy of the movable and the immovable beings capable of enchanting everyone.</li>
                         <li>Thou hast manifested thyself as Sri, a garland round Kesava's form, wllo in the form of Earth boldest everything within, who art of yore the great Goddess causing creation and .the destruction of the three worlds and art
                         beyond the three GUnas.</li>
                         <li>Thou art present in everything even in the essential atom and who art charmingly honoured by Yogins; who art perceivable in the hearts of the Yogins purified by res- traints, as well as in the path of their meditation.</li>
                         <li>Thou art the Vidya of diverse sorts. Thou art endowed with illumination, purity and detachment. Thou assumest Kiitastha (perpetually immovable), Avyakta
                         (unmanifest) and Ananta (infinite) form and Thou art the eternal time holding all the worlds.</li>
                         <li> 0 Siva, Thou art the prime cause of the three GuQ.as and art still beyond them. But in conjunction with the GuQ.as, Thou certainly infusest the seed of change in e_very matter.</li>
                         <li>Thou art the fourth to the three Gunas viz. Sattva, Rajas and Tamas; but devoid of their depravity though these originate from Thee; Thou createst, protectest and devourest the whole universe within and without having three GuQ.as as its only cause.</li>
                         <li>I pay my homage to Thee, 0 Siva's consort, for the eternal welfare of the universe. 0 seed of all the worlds, Thou art knowable as well as knowledge Thyself.</li>

                         <li>0 Goddess of devas, Siva the Yogin, who is your husband and who as Rudra manifested Himself formerly through my forehead has now occupied Kailasa.</li>

                         <li>T0 Sati, fascinate Him lest He should cast His glance on another lady. Excepting you none will be able to capture his mind.</li>
                         <li>Hence, you alone should fascinate Siva through our beauty. 0 Siva, being born as daughter you should become Rudra's wife.</li>

                         <li>The bull-emblemed deity rebuked me merely for my feelings of love for a woman. How can He take a wife unto Himself, 0 Goddess, on His own accord ?</li>
                         <li>Siva is the cause of this universe in the beginning, middle and end. If He remains detached and refuses to take a wife, how can auspicious creation come into being ?</li>
                         <li>This thought has tormented me. It was not conducive to any benefit to seek another shelter. So I request you for the benefit of the universe to accomplish the undertaking.</li>
                         <li>0 mother of the universe, is not competent to enthral Him, nor nor Kama, nor I; in fact no one other than you.</li>
                         <li>Hence be born as daughter, the great Goddess of celestial beauty. Inspired by my devotion, be pleased to become His wife and fascinate the lord who at present is detached from the world.</li>
                         <li>0 Goddess of devas, is performing a penance on the north of the milky ocean* with his mind controlled and directed towards you. He is steady in perform- ing the rite.</li>
                         <li>On hearing roy words Siva began to reflect then. The mother of the universe, surprised in her mind, spoke these words.</li>

                         <li>For three thousand divine years he performed the penance with good sacred rites, controlling his mind and keeping himself pure.</li>
                         <li>For some years, he sustained himself on taking in only air, abstaining from food, for some years taking only water and for some years taking only leaves as food. Thus he
                         spent the time meditating upon the Goddess in cosmic form.</li>
                         <li>He was intensively devoted to the meditation of the Goddess. He was engaged in the penance for a long time. With sacred rites and various restraints he worshipped the .
                         Goddess.</li>

                        pointed out the way to calmness.</li>
                        <li>On being consoled by me, Daksa begot a thousand sons named Sabalasvas in the daughter of Pancajana.</li>

                        <li>At the very touch of waters of the Nadiyal).a lake they too had their sins quelled and became purified. They
                        performed penance, strenuously repeating many mantras and

                        <li>When she saw both of us honoured and bowed to by her father, Sati following the conventions of the world, saluted us with joy and reverence.</li>
                        <li>At the end of obeisance, 0 Narada, you and I sat in the fine seat provided by Daksa. When she humbly bowed again, I spoke to her.</li>
                        <li>0 Sati, secure, as your husband, the lord of the universe, (the omniscient Siva) who only and whom you too desire. </li>
                        <li>0 auspicious lady, you shall secure, as your husband, the person who has not taken, does not take, and will not be taking another wife. He will be unlike others.</li>
                        <li>0 Narada, after saying this to Sati we stayed in Daksa's abode for a long time. We were bidden farewell by him and we went to our respective places.</li>
                        <li>On hearing that, Daksa became delighted and free from all worries. Thinking that she was a great Goddess, he took her with him.</li>
                        <li>Thus with various charming girlish sports the Goddess who is favourably disposed to her devotees and who had assumed human form out of her own will passed the

                        <li>After passing her girlhood and reaching the state of early youth she attained beauty in every limb which blazed forth brilliantly.</li>
                        <li>Daksa the lord of worlds, on seeing her blooming in the proper age thought within-"How shall I give my daughter to Siva ?"</li>
                        <li>She too desired to attain Siva. Her desire grew every day. After knowing her father's idea, she approached her mother.</li>
                        <li>Sati, the great Goddess of wide intellect; sought the permission of her mother to perform the penance with Siva as the goal, for the happiness of her mother</li>

                        <li>She kept awake in the fuii-moon night of Magha (January·February) and worshipped Siva on the banks of the river wearing wet clothes.</li>
                        <li>On the fourteenth day of the dark half of Phalguna (February-March), she kept awake in the night and performed special worship of Siva with Bilva fruits and

                        <li>Keeping strict control over her diet and repeating various mantras she worshipped Siva with different fruits,  flowers and leaves fresh and readily available.</li>
                        <li>The Goddess Sati who had assumed human form out of her will, became firmly devoted to the worship of Siva on every day and month. </li>
                        <li>Concluding all the sacred rites of Nanda, Sati began to meditate on Siva with concentrated devotion. She was steady and she never thought of any one else.</li>
                        <li>In the meantime, 0 sage, devas and sages with Vishnu and me at their head came to see the penance of Sati.</li>
                        <li>On arrival, Sati was seen by the devas as an achievement in embodied form or as success incarnate. She was
                        completely engrossed in meditating on Siva. She had reached the stage of the enlightened seers.</li>
                        <li>With palms joined in reverence, the devas paid respects to Sati joyfully. The sages bent down their shoulders in respect. and others became delighted.</li>

                        <li>0 sage, when we were asked by Siva thus, I, the grandfather of the worlds, spoke to Lord Siva on being prompted by Visnu</li>
                        <li>0 great lord, lord of Devas, 0 lord, the ocean of mercy, please listen why we both have come here in the company of Devas and sages.</li>
                        <li>0 bull-emblemed deity, we have come here particularly for your sake, along with these suppliants. Otherwise the universe would not be in a proper state always.</li>
                        <li>0 great lord, some demons are to be killed by me, some by Visnu and some by you.</li>
                        <li>0 great lord, some of them would be killed by  your son and some will be killed by me.</li>
                        <li>The devas attain happiness only by your favour. The universe can attain peace and fearlessness only after destroying the demons.</li>
                        <li>Or they cannot be killed by you in as much as you are always merciful, free from love and hate and engaged in Yoga.</li>
                        <li>0 lord, Vnadhvaja,<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (262)</note> how can the activities of creation, sustenance and dissolution be carried on properly
                        for ever, if they are not killed?</li>
                        <li>The activities of creation, sustenance and dissolution are to be persued by us now and then. The difference in
                        our bodies is perceptible only through illusion.</li>
                        <li>Though our real form is one, we are different in as much as our activities are different. If there is no functional difference, the difference in forms is meaningless.</li>
                        <li>The same supreme Atman, lord Siva manifests in three different ways due to Maya. The lord is independent
                        in his divine sports. </li>
                        <li>Visnu is born of his left limb. I am born of the right limb. You are born of the heart of Siva and are his full-fledged incarnation.</li>
                        <li>Thus, 0 lord, we have become three, with different forms. We are the sons of Siva and Siva which, 0 eternal one, you must note.</li>
                        <li>Visnu and I have become united with our wives for the performance of our function. 0 lord, with great pleasure we carry on our activities in the world at your
                        bidding.</li>
                        <li>Hence, for the benefit of the universe, for the happiness of the devas, you must accept an auspicious lady as
                        your wife.</li>
                        <li>0 great lord, please listen to another incident of bygone days, just recollected by me. You yourself as Siva mentioned this to us formerly.</li>
                        <li>"0 Brahma, this my great form, exactly as this, will be manifested through your limb. He will be known as Rudra in the world.</li>
                        <li>Brahma is the cause of creation, Vishnu is sustainer. I shall be the cause of dissolution in the form of Rudra, a
                        Saguna form.</li>
                        <li>I shall marry a woman and perform the excellent function." These are your words. Remembering these words please fulfil your promise.</li>
                        <li>0 lord, this is your own directive that I be the creator and Vishnu the protector. Siva Himself has manifested in your form as the cause of dissolution.</li>
                        <li>We two are unable to perform our duties without you. Hence take up a beloved consort who too will be engaged in the activities of creation.</li>
                        <li>0 Siva, accept a beloved wife as a life companion in the same manner as Visnu has taken the Goddess of the lotus and I have taken the goddess of speech.</li>
                        <li>On hearing these words of mine-of Brahma-in the presence of Vigm, Siva, the lord of worlds spoke to me with his face beaming with a smile. </li>

                        <li>You two are the best among the devas. You are the masters of three worlds. What you say is indeed weighty since you two are engaged in Siva's work.</li>

                        own soul, freed of attachment, unsullied, with the body of an ascetic, possessed of knowledge, seeing himself, free from
                        aberrations and a non-reveller. Besides I am always unclean and inauspicious. Hence say now what can I do with a loving wife ?</li>
                        <li>Even as I am engaged in Yoga, I experience the mystic Bliss. Only a man devoid of perfect knowledge will make much of marriage and desire it. Actually it is a
                        great bondage. Hence I am not interested in it. This is truth. I am telling you the truth.</li>

                        <li> 0 Visnu, 0 Brahma, you must hear what sort of a wife I will be taking in accordance with that promise. What I say is indeed proper.</li>

                        <li>She must be a Yogini when I practise Yoga and a loving woman when I indulge in love.</li>
                        <li>Sometimes I will be thinking about Siva, my  own form of splendour, the eternal principle which the scholars
                        well versed in the Vedas call Imperishable. When I go in trance, 0 Brahma, in that meditation, damned be she who causes an impediment therein</li>
                        <li>You, Visnu and I are the parts exceedingly of Brahman. So we are exceedingly fortunate. It is but proper to think about Him.</li>

                        activities ever.</li>
                        <li>There is another condition to which please also  listen, 0 Brahma. If she evinces a disbelief in me or in what I say, I shall abandon her.  </li>

                        pleasing everyone.</li>
                        <li>Then a surprisingly strange event occurred there. Dear one, listen to it. I shall tell you.</li>
                        <li>Siva's power of illusion is inscrutable. The whole universe, the mobile or immobile, is deluded by it, Devas and Asuras.</li>
                        <li>Formerly I wished to delude Siva by deceitful means. But now Siva Himself has deluded me by means of His divine sports.</li>
                        <li>If a man wishes evil of others, he himself becomes the victim of the same. There is no doubt about it. Realising this, no man shall wish evil of anyone else.</li>
                        <li>0 sage, while going round the fire, the feet of Sati protruded out of the cloth that covered them. I looked at them.</li>
                        <li>My mind being afflicted by love I stared at the limbs of Sati. 0 excellent .brahmin, I was deluded by Siva's Maya.</li>
                        <li>The more I stared at the beautiful limbs of Sati eagerly the more I became thriJled like a love-afflicted man.</li>
                        <li>Staring thus at the chaste daughter of Daksa and being afflicted by the cupid,, 0 sage, I craved to see her face.</li>
                        <li>Since she was bashful in the presence of Siva I could not see her face. She did not show out her face on account of shyness. </li>
                        <li>Then I began to consider proper means whereby I could see the face. Afflicted much by the cupid, I pitched
                        upon the production of airful smoke as the means thereof.</li>
                        <li>I put many wet twigs into the fire. Only very little ghee did I pour into the fire. Much smoke arose out of the fire from the wet twigs, so much so that darkness enveloped the whole altar ground (and the neighbour·
                        hood).</li>
                        <li>Then lord Siva, the supreme God, indulged in many sports, covered his eyes (apparently) afflicted by smoke.</li>
                        <li>Then, 0 sage, afflicted by the cupid and delighted in the heart of hearts, I lifted her veil and stared into the face of Sati.</li>
                        <li>I looked at the face of Sati many a time. I was helpless in curbing the onset of a sensuous orgasm.</li>
                        <li>Four drops of my semen virile got displaced and fell on the ground like drops of dew as a result of staring into her face.</li>
                        <li>0 sage, then I was stunned into silence. I was surprised. I became suspicious. I covered up the semen drops lest anyone should see them.</li>
                        <li>But the lord Siva saw it by His divine vision. The trickling down of the semen excited His fury and He said</li>

                                    Siva was not happy without her even for a moment.</li>
                                    <li>After dallying among the hedges and grottos in the Kailasa mountain for a long time he went to the Himalayan ridges where he remembered Kama out of his own accord.</li>

                                    <li>The Palasa flowers resembling the hue of the twilight and shaped like the crescent moon shone like the flowery arrows of Kama at the feet of trees.</li>

                                    <li>With full-blown lotuses, the pure waters of the lakes shone like the minds of sages wherein the supreme

                                    <li> The nights became bright with the moon devoid of  mist. Lovely women shone beautifully in the company of their lovers.</li>
                                    <li>In this atmosphere, on that excellent mountain,  Lord Siva sported about for a long time among the groves, hedges and streams in the company of Sati.</li>

                                    <li>The goddess satisfied his mind in fulness in the  matter of intercourse. She seemed to enter his body. He made her drink that juice.</li>
                                    <li>With garlands of flowers wreathed by himself he decorated her person and felt new pleasures.</li>
                                    <li>With diverse conversations, glances, joking remarks and exchanges of pleasantries he instructed Siva in the knowledge of Self.</li>
                                    <li>Drinking the nectar from her moon-face, Siva stabilised his body. Sometimes he experienced exhilarating and particularly pleasing state.</li>
                                    <li>Just as a huge elephant that is bound with ropes cannot have any other activity. He was also bound by the sweet fragrance of her lotus-like face, her beauty and her
                                    jocular pleasantries.</li>
                                    <li>Thus in the ridges and caverns of the Himalayan mountains, the lord sported about in the company of Sati every day. According to the calculation of the devas twenty
                                    five years elapsed, 0 celestial sage, during which he dallied thus. </li>

                                    <li>0 Goddess Sati, listen, I shall explain the great  principle whereby the remorseful creature becomes a liberated soul.</li>
                                    <li>0 great Goddess, know that the perfect knowledge is the great principle-the consciousness that "I am Brahman" in the perfect intellect where nothing else is
                                    remembered.</li>
                                    <li>This consciousness is very rare in the three worlds. 0 beloved, I am Brahman, the greatest of the great and very few are those who know my real nature.</li>
                                    <li>Devotion to me is considered as the bestower of worldly pleasures and salvation. It is achievable only by my grace. It is nine-fold.</li>
                                    <li>There is no difference between devotion and perfect knowledge. A person who is engrossed in devotion enjoys perpetual happiness. Perfect knowledge never
                                    descends in a vicious person averse to devotion.</li>
                                    <li>Attracted by devotion and as a result of its influence, 0 Goddess, I go even to the houses of the baseborn and outcastes. There is no doubt about it.</li>
                                    <li>Devotion is variously classified as attributive and attribute1ess, as conventional and natural, greater and lesser, perpetual and non-perpetual. There are six further
                                    subdivisions of the perpetual devotion. Scholars further classify it into enjoined and non-enjoined. Thus devotions are manifold which have been explained elsewhere.</li>
                                    <li>0 beloved, sages have explained that the different kinds of devotion have nine ancillary adjuncts. 0 daughter of Daksa I shall narrate them to which you listen with love.</li>
                                    <li>According to scholars 0 Goddess, the nine ancillary adjuncts are :-listening, eulogising, remembering, ·serving, surrendering, worshipping, saluting, friendliness and
                                    dedication. 0 Siva (Sati), its further subdivisions too have been explained.</li>
                                    <li>0 Goddess, listen to the characteristics of these  nine adjuncts separately. By listening is meant the imbibing of my stories that bestow worldly pleasures and salvation,
                                    with great devotion, in steady posture.</li>
                                    <li>After conceiving in the mind the details of my manifestations and activities, loudly and cheerfully, proclaiming the same in order to eulogise me is what is called
                                    eulogising.</li>
                                    <li>0 Goddess, after realising me to be all-pervading  a feeling of fearlessness is what is called remembering.</li>
                                    <li>The service rendered to the godhead commencing at the early dawn, with mind, speech, hands and feet is what is called serving.</li>
                                    <li>Surrendering oneself in the service of the godhead who is worthy of being served and serving with all the sense-organs feeling hearty sense of elation is what is called
                                    surrendering.</li>
                                    <li>Offering sixteen types of service to me, the upreme soul, in accordance with one's capacity is called worshipping. The sixteen types of service are Padya<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (287)</note>
                                    etc.</li>
                                    <li> Meditating in the mind, repeating the mantras  and touching the ground with eight limbs<noteref3_note3footer>(3) - (288)</note> is called saluting.</li>
                                    <li>The belief-"Whatever god bestows on me, good or bad, is for my welfare" -is the characteristic sign of  friendliness.</li>
                                    <li>Dedicating everything, the body and other possessions, for the propitiation of the godhead and retaining nothing for oneself is called dedication.</li>
                                    <li>hese nine adjuncts to the devotion to me, cause  perfect knowledge, bestow wordly pleasures and salvation and are pleasing to me. </li>
                                    <li>The further subdivisions in the adjuncts are numerous. Nurturing the Bilva tree etc. can be included therein. They shall be thought of by the devotee himself.</li>
                                    <li>0 beloved, thus my devotion with various adjuncts and ancillaries, is contributory to salvation since it is  productive of perfect Knowledge and Detachment. It is the
                                    most excellent path.</li>
                                    <li>A true devotion is as endearing to me as to you. It is productive of the fruits of all rites for ever. He who has it in his mind is a great favourite of mine.</li>
                                    <li>There is no other path as easy and pleasing as devotion in the three worlds, 0 goddess of devas, in all the four Yugas generally and in the Kaliyuga particularly.</li>
                                    <li>Knowledge (Jniana) and Detachment (Vairagya) have grown old and have lost their lustre in the Kali Age. They have become decayed and worn-out as the people who
                                    can grasp them are rare.</li>
                                    <li>In the Kali age as in all the four Yugas there is immediate and visible benefit in devotion. I am subservient to a devotee in view of the power of devotion.</li>
                                    <li>I always assist a man endowed with devotion and remove his obstacles. A person devoid of devotion is worthy of being punished. There is no doubt about it.</li>
                                    <li>I am the protector· of my devotees. For the  protection of a devotee of mine I burnt the God of death, 0 goddess, in the fire emerging from my eyes.</li>
                                    <li>For the sake of a devotee of mine I became very furious with the sun formerly. I over-powered him with  my trident.</li>
                                    <li>I was not a party to the evil actions of Ravana  (though he was my devotee). For the sake of another  devotee I discarded Ravana with all his followers.</li>
                                    <li>0 goddess, for the sake of a devotee, I angrily  expelled Vyasa when he had a vicious thought, from Kasi after punishing him duly through Nandin.</li>
                                    <li>Why shall I say more, 0 Goddess ? I am always subservient to a devotee, always under the control of a person who practises devotion. There ·is no doubt
                                    in this. </li>

                                    <li>All the devas, the guardians of the quarters of rising fortune, the subordinate devas with their offers of help and service attended the sacrifice.</li>
                                    <li>From Satyaloka, I, the creator of the universe, was duly lauded and taken there along with my sons, followers and the embodied forms of the Vedas etc. </li>
                                    <li>Visnu was duly requested, respected and brought to the place of sacrifice from Vaikuntha<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (300)</note> along with his aide-decamp and followers.</li>
                                    <li>Similarly others too, equally deluded, came to the sacrifice. Then Daksa who was ill disposed towards Siva received them hospitably.</li>
                                    <li>Large divine mansions of great value and brilliant lustre were erected by Tvastr<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (301)</note> and assigned to them by Daksa</li>
                                    <li>In all those places they stationed themselves in a befitting manner after being duly honoured. They shone along with Visnu and me.</li>

                                    Ritviks by him (Daksa).</li>
                                    <li>Visnu himself was the presiding officer along with the Maruts. I was the Brahma (a special officiating deity)  the director and guide for Vedic rituals.</li>
                                    <li>he guardians of the quarters became the gatekeepers and watchmen. They were well-equipped in arms and had many attendants to assist them. They were very
                                    enthusiastic.</li>
                                    <li>In that altar, sacrifice itself was present in its  beautiful embodied form. The excellent sages became the holders of the Vedas.</li>
                                    <li>The sacrificial .fire evinced its diverse forms in a thousand ways, during the sacrificial festivities, in order to
                                    receive the sacrificial offerings of Daksa</li>
                                    <li>There were eightysix thousand Ritviks <noteref4_note4footer>(4) - (303)</note> in the performance of the sacrifice and sixtyfour thousand Udgatrs.
                                    The celestial sages Narada and others acted as Adhvaryus and Hotrs. They too were as many. The seven sages (jointly and) severally repeated the Saman hymns.</li>
                                    <li>In his great sacrifice Daksa extended his invitation to Gandharvas, Vidyadharas, Siddhas, Adityas, all the
                                    innumerable Nagas along with their followers and sacrificial ritualists.</li>

                                    <li>Daksa the evil-minded, did not invite Siva for that sacrifice, deciding that He was not worthy of taking part in the sacrifice because He was a Kapalin<noteref7_note5footer>(7) - (307)</note></li>
                                    <li>In view of the fact that Sati was the wife of Kapalin, she was not invited, though she was his beloved daughter, by Daksa who was blind to her qualities.</li>
                                    <li>While the great festivities in the sacrifice of Daksa were being celebrated those who had assembled for the same were engrossed in their respective activities.</li>
                                    <li>In the meantime, Dadhici<noteref8_note8footer>(8) - (308)</note>a devotee of Siva, realising that lord Siva was not there became dispirited and spoke thus. </li>

                                    <li>0 ye all ! celestial sages and others, pay heed to my words. Why has not Siva taken part in the festivities of this sacrifice ?</li>
                                    <li>Of course, the chiefs of devas, the great sages and the guardians of the quarters have all come. Yet the sacrifice cannot be perfect and complete without the noble-souled,
                                    trident-holder Siva.</li>
                                    <li>The bull-bannered, blue-necked eternal Purusa the great Isa is not seen here. Great scholars have affirmed, that all auspicious results happen due to Him alone.</li>
                                    <li>0 Daksa, if accepted by Triyambaka all inauspicious things become auspicious and fresh auspicious things take shape which will be greater than the greatest in a trice.</li>
                                    <li>Hence the invitation to the great Siva shall be extended by you yourself immediately or by Brahma or by Visnu the lord.</li>

                                    <li>0 lords of Devas, everything shall be sanctified through Siva, the supreme Self. If the consort of Siva, the  great Being, comes here, everything will be all right.</li>
                                    <li>Since all merits accrue from thinking upon Him and repeating His names, the bull-bannered deity shall be  brought with aU efforts.</li>
                                    <li>If Siva comes here, the sacrifice will become sanctified, or it will remain incomplete and imperfect. I am  telling you the truth.</li>

                                    <li>Having sipped water duly, covering up her body entirely with her cloth she closed her eyes and remembered her lord. She then entered the yogic trance.</li>

                                    took it through the throat and finally fixed it in the middle of the eyebrows.</li>
                                    <li>She desired to cast-off her body due to her anger with Daksa. She desired to burn off the body and retain the pure wind by yogic means. In this posture she
                                    remembered the feet of her lord and nothing else.</li>
                                    <li>Her body divested of its sins fell in the yogic fire and was reduced to ashes, 0 excellent sage, in accordance  with her own wish.</li>
                                    <li>The loud shouts and cries of "Ha: Ha" of those who witnessed it spread everywhere on the earth and rose  up in the sky. Everything was surprisingly wonderful and
                                    terrifying to the devas and others.</li>
                                    <li>"Alas, Siva's beloved Goddess, nay his deity, Sati has cast-off her life. Who is that wicked person who angered her?</li>
                                    <li>See the unholy unspiritual misdeed of Daksa, the patriarch, the son of Brahma whose subjects are the mobile and immobile creatures of the world. </li>
                                    <li>Alas, Sati, the noble beloved of the bull-bannered deity has become dispirited. She ought to have been  honoured duly.</li>
                                    <li>This patriarch of hardened heart, inimical to the Brahman, will definitely become infamous in the whole world.</li>
                                    <li>Since he refused to comply with the request of his own daughter he will be falling into a terrible hell after death due to his own guilt.</li>
                                    <li>When people were saying thus on seeing the selfimmolation of Sati, her attendants rose up in anger with their weapons.</li>
                                    <li>They had been waiting near the door numbering sixty thousand. Those powerful attendants of lord Siva became furious.</li>
                                    <li>Those attendants of Siva shouted exclamations-Ha Ha, fie, fie, no, no, loudly and frequently.</li>
                                    <li>The quarters were pervaded with the shouts of Ha, Ha. The devas and sages who had assembled there were struck with fear.</li>
                                    <li>Consulting one another, the attendants lifted their weapons furiously and the atmosphere was pervaded with the sound of their arms.</li>
                                    <li> 0 celestial sage, some of them excessively stricken  with grief cut off their limbs with their weapons, some their
                                    heads, some their faces, with the sharp lethal weapons they had.</li>
                                    <li>Thus about twentythousand of those attendants courted death along with Sati. It was very surprising.</li>
                                    <li>Such of the attendants of the noble-souled Siva  who survived, jumped up with their weapons to kill the furious Daksa</li>
                                    <li>On seeing the force of their onslaught, 0 sages, the holy sage Bhrgu poured offering in the fire with the Yajur mantra to quell the obstructors of sacrifice.</li>
                                    <li>While the sage Bhrgu was pouring the offerings, thousands of powerful demons - Rbhus<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (318)</note> - rose up</li>
                                    <li>0 excellent sage, a terrible fight ensued between Siva's attendants and the demons who had firebrands for their weapons. Their hair stood on end when people heard
                                    the uproar.</li>
                                    <li>The attendants were killed by the :Rbhus of powerful valour and favoured with Brahminical splendour. They were forced to run without difficulty.</li>
                                    <li>It had been the desire of Siva of the great Sakti that the attendants were killed and routed quickly. It was a wonderful scene.</li>
                                    <li>On seeing this, the sages, Indra and other devas, the Maruts, the Visvedevas, the Asvins and the -guardians of the quarters kept silent.</li>
                                    <li>Some of them went to request and consult with Visnu frequently for preventing obstacles. They were greatly  agitated.</li>
                                    <li>The sensible devas, Visnu and others, became agitated on pondering over the results of Pramathas' destruction and routing.</li>
                                    <li>Such was the obstacle to the sacrifice of Daksa  who rivalled with Siva, who was wicked and who professed  to be a kinsman of Brahma, 0 sage. </li>

                                    <li>If the devas were to come to your assistance, they are sure to be destroyed like moths by fire.</li>
                                    <li>Let your face burn. Let your sacrifice ·be quashed. Whoever comes as your assistant-let him be burnt today immediately.</li>
                                    <li>An oath on all the devas for your inauspiciousness, if they are to assist your wickedness.</li>
                                    <li>Let all the devas depart quickly from this sacrificial altar. Otherwise you all will perish today without an escape.</li>
                                    <li>Let all the sages, Nagas and others leave this sacrifice. Otherwise, you all will perish today, without an escape.</li>
                                    <li>0 come out of this sacrificial platform quickly. Otherwise you will perish today without an escape.</li>

                                    <li> When Virabhadra set off thus, bad omens were seen by Daska and the devas.</li>
                                    <li>0 celestial sage, when Virabhadra accompanied by the Ganas proceeded thus, many portentous phenomena occurred at the sacrifice of including the three evil
                                    omens, boding the imminent destruction of sacrifice.</li>
                                    <li>he left eye, arm and thigh of Daksa throbbed. In every respect, it indicated everything inauspicious It was harassing to him.</li>
                                    <li>There was an earthquake at the site of sacrifice. Daksa observed the mysterious phenomena of stars at noon.</li>
                                    <li>The quarters became dirty and gloomy. The sun appeared spotted and terrifying with thousands of circlets all round.</li>
                                    <li>Stars, brilliant like lightning and blazing fire were seen falling. Some of them went zigzag and some fell with face downwards.</li>
                                    <li>Thousands of vultures hovered above touching Daksa's head. Shadows of these darkened the sacrificial platform.</li>
                                    <li>Jackals howled in the surroundings of the sacrificial ground. The evil star Netraka and meteors seemed to fall
                                    like white scorpions. </li>
                                    <li>Rough winds raising a lot of dust blew there. Locusts and moths were tossed about by whirlwinds.</li>
                                    <li>The wonderfully new sacrificial platform erected by Daska and the devas was thrown up by the winds.</li>
                                    <li>Surprisingly enough, Daksa and others vomitted blood, pieces of flesh and bones very frequently.</li>
                                    <li>They became unsteady and tremulous like lamps blown by wind. They felt miserable as if struck with the sharp edges of weapons.</li>
                                    <li>The eyes of Daksa and others sometimes resembled the fading lotuses of the summer; sometimes they resembled the flowers in forests with dews trickling from them;
                                    sometimes they seemed like lotuses at night and sometimes  like Kumuda flowers in the forenoon.</li>
                                    <li>The deities seemed to shower blood; the quarters became enveloped in darkness; there was a peculiar blaze everywhere terrifying all.</li>
                                    <li>0 sage, devas and others saw such evil portents as these. Visnu and others were struck with great fear.</li>
                                    <li>"Ha, we are doomed" saying thus they fell unconscious on the ground like trees on the edges of rivers when felled by the force of the current.</li>
                                    <li>Fallen on the ground they remained motionless like cruel serpents struck dead. Sometimes those fallen bounced up like balls.</li>
                                    <li>Then due to extreme distress they cried like twittering sparrows. Their groans and their voices got confusingly mingled with each other.</li>
                                    <li>Everyone including Visnu had their power blunted and impeded. They rol1ed and dashed against one another like tortoises.</li>
                                    <li>In the meantime a disembodied voice arose there within the hearing of the devas and that of Daksa particularly. The ethereal voice said.</li>
                                    <li>Fie upon your life now, 0 Daksa You are evilminded and excessively foolish. Great misery caused by Siva will inevitably befall you.</li>
                                    <li>Certainly great misery will befall those foolish devas and others who are here crying out ''Ha Ha". </li>
                                    <li>On hearing that voice of the sky, and seeing those ill omens, Daksa was terribly afraid. The othersdevas etc.-too followed suit.</li>
                                    <li>Trembling miserably and utterly shaken, Daska sought refuge in Visnu the consort of Laxmi and his own lord.</li>
                                    <li>Making humble obeisance in his fright, and eu. logising in his mental distress, he said thus to Visnu endearing to his own men</li></ol>

                                    of Rudra's anger has now come to the sacrificial yard.</li>
                                    <li>There is no doubt in this that he has come for destroying us. There is nothing impossible for him to do, whatever it may be really.</li>
                                    <li>It is certain that this great lord will become tranquil only after burning us all</li>
                                    <li> Since by my mistake I have transgressed the affirmation of lord Siva, I too shall bear the miseries along with you.</li>
                                    <li>0 Daksa I have no power to prevent this since I have become an enemy of Siva by transgressing his affirmation.</li>
                                    <li>There can be no happiness to the enemies of Siva  in the three periods of time; misery has of necessity been invited by me along with you.</li>
                                    <li>My discus Sudarsana will not hit him. My discus  is Saiva {belonging to Siva) and it can cause the death of only non-Saivas.</li>
                                    <li>Even if Virabhadra had not been here, this discus would have killed us and returned to Siva.</li>
                                    <li>This discus has remained without killing me, although I had transgressed the avowal of Siva. It indicates
                                    that it is compassionate.</li>
                                    <li>Hereafter this discus will not stay with me. With its fiery effusions it will depart quickly.</li>
                                    <li>Even if he is worshipped and honoured by us with respect, Virabhadra will not protect us since he is extremely angry.</li>
                                    <li>A sudden dissolution of every one of us is imminent. Alas, it. ha-s already set upon us.</li>
                                    <li>There is none to offer us refuge in· the three worlds. Who can be the refuge of an enemy of Siva in this world?</li>
                                    <li>Even if the body undergoes destruction,. the torture at the hands of Yama<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (327)</note> is in store for us. It is impossible
                                    to bear as it generates much misery.</li>
                                    <li>On seeing an enemy of Siva, Yama gnashes his teeth. He puts him in cauldrons of oil and not otherwise.</li>
                                    <li> Actually I was preparing to leave after an open declaration. Still I did not leave immediately by the contagious sin of this wicked person.</li>
                                    <li>Even if we flee from this place, Virabhadra the devotee of Siva, will drag and pull us by means of his weapons.</li>
                                    <li>Whether it is heaven or earth, Patala or any where else, it is not difficult for the weapons of Virabhadra to gain access there.</li>
                                    <li>Such is the power of everyone of the attendants  of the tride11t-bearing Rudra.</li>
                                    <li>Formerly at Kasi, Kalabhairava had plucked off the fifth head of Brahma playfully with the tip of his nail.</li>
                                    <li></li>
                                    <li>After saying this, Visnu resumed his seat, his lotusface showing signs of great fear. At the same time Virabhadra too reached the sacrificial platform.</li>
                                    <li>While was saying this, the gods and others
                                    saw the vast ocean of the army led by Virabhadra already come there </li>

                                    Severely wounded by the arrows, Indra and other leaders of devas fled in all the ten directions. When the guardians of the quarters and other devas had fled, Virabhadra came very

                                    <li>They too fought against Virabhadra who continued to shout. These strong groups of warriors were as strong as Visnu and had various weapons with them.</li>
                                    <li>Remembering Siva, his lord and hitting them, who were as lustrous as Narayana with his trident, he reduced them to ashes.</li>
                                    <li>The most powerful Virabhadra struck Visnu in the chest playfully with his trident in the course of the battle.</li>
                                    <li>0 sage, hit suddenly by that blow, Visnu Purusottama, fell unconscious on the ground.</li>
                                    <li>Then arose a wonderful brilliance as terrible as the fire at the time of dissolution. ·It seemed to burn all the three worlds. It was severe and terrifying even to great
                                    heroes.</li>
                                    <li>That glorious lord, with eyes red by anger, got up again. The best of beings lifted up his discus and stood ready to strike. </li>
                                    <li>Virabhadra of no weak soul, nay, identical with lord Siva, held his terrific discus luminous like black sun suspended and motionless.</li>
                                    <li>0 sage, thanks to the power of Siva, the great lord controlling Maya, the Cakra held in the hand of  Visnu became stunned and motionless.</li>
                                    <li>Visnu who was kept stunned by Virabhadra of eloquent words who was the lord of the Ganas, remained motionless like a mountain.</li>
                                    <li>0 Narada, when he became benumbed and stunned, Visnu repeated formulas for redemption from torpidity.</li>
                                    <li>0 sage, becoming freed from the stunned state, Visnu became infuriated and took up his bow and arrows.</li>
                                    <li>0 dear sage, Visnu's bow was attacked with three arrows by Virabhadra whereupon it split into three in a trice.</li>
                                    <li>Then Visnu was enlightened by the great voice that the great Ganas were invincible. He therefore thought of vanishing from the scene.</li>
                                    <li>On coming to know that all this was bound to happen brought about by Sati, so unbearable to all others,
                                    all of us went to our respective worlds after duly remembering Siva, the independent lord of all.</li>
                                    <li>When I returned to Satyaloka the grief of my son afflicted me much. In my miserable plight I pondered over what shall be done by me.</li>
                                    <li>When Visnu and I had gone, accompanied by Devas and sages, all those who were left there, those who maintained themselves through sacrifices, were utterly
                                    defeated by the Ganas.</li>
                                    <li>On seeing the disorder and utter destruction of the great sacrifice, the sacrifice itself being afraid assumed the form of a deer and fled.</li>
                                    <li>Virabhadra seized it as it, was fleeing up the sky in the form of a deer and beheaded it.</li>
                                    <li>Then the heroic Mahagrana Virabhadra caught hold of Prajapati, Dharma, Kasyapa, Aristenim the sage with many sons, the sages Angiras and K.rsasva and the
                                    great sage Datta and kicked all of them on their heads. </li>
                                    <li>With the tip of his fingers he cut off the tip of the nose of Sarasvati and of Aditi the mother of devas.  Virabhadra showed his exploits thus.</li>
                                    <li>Similarly the infuriated Virabhadra with eyes blazing, cut off the other devas too and threw them on the ground.</li>
                                    <li>Even after mutilating the chief devas and sages, he never became calm like the king of serpents whose anger had been aroused.</li>
                                    <li>After uprooting his enemies, like a lion the elephants of the forest, Virabhadra surveyed all the quarters
                                    frequently to know "who is where".</li>
                                    <li>He struck and smashed Bhrgu while the valorous Manibhadra<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (329)</note> kicked him on his chest and plucked off his moustaches.</li>
                                    <li>Canda forcibly plucked off the teeth of Pusan<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (330)</note> who had formerly laughed and showed his teeth while Siva
                                    was being cursed.</li>
                                    <li>Nandin plucked out the eyes of Bhaga who was felled over the ground with anger because it was he who winked at Daksa while cursing.</li>
                                    <li>Svadha, Svaha, Daksina,Mantras and Tantras, all those who were there were molested and mortified by the leaders of Ganas</li>
                                    <li>The Ganas furiously showered filth and rubbish on the sacrificial fire. The heroic Ganas made the sacrifice inexpressibly impure.</li>
                                    <li>After coming to know that Daksa had hidden himself behind the altar due to his fright, Virabhadra dragged him out with force.</li>
                                    <li>He was caught hold ofby his cheeks, his head and  was struck with the sword. Due to the yogic power of Daksa it could not be split.</li>
                                    <li>Thinking that his head could not be pierced or cut with weapons he kicked his chest with the foot and wrested the head with his hand.</li>
                                    <li>Virabhadra the leader of the GanaS threw the head of the wicked Daksa the enemy of Siva, into the firepit.</li>
                                    <li>Virabhadra whirling the trident in his· hand looked splendid indeed. The angry Ranaksa and Samvarta looked like the blazing mountains.</li>
                                    <li>After killing them without difficulty Virabhadra in his fury burnt them in the fire like a blazing conflagration consuming moths.</li>
                                    <li>Seeing Daksa and others entirely burnt, he laughed boisterously filling the three worlds with the sound.</li>
                                    <li>He was surrounded by heroic glory. Then a divine shower of flowers originating from the celestial park fell over Virabhadra accompanied by his Ganas.</li>
                                    <li>Cool breezes blew gently fragrant and pleasing. · Divine drums sounded simultaneously.</li>
                                    <li>The hero who had accomplished his duties went to Kailasa quickly like the sun who quells darkness.</li>
                                    <li>On seeing Virabhadra who had fulfilled his task, lord Siva was pleased and he made him the presiding officer
                                    of his Ganas. </li>

                                    <li>We worship the three-eyed lord Siva, the lord of the three worlds, the father of the three spheres, the lord of the three gunas.</li>
                                    <li>Lord Siva is the essence, the fragrance of the  three Tattvas, three fires, of every thing that is trichotomised, of the three worlds, of the three arms and of the trinity. He
                                    is the nourisher. In all living beings, everywhere, in the three GUnas, in the creation, in the sense-organs, in the devas and Ganas, he is the essence as the fragrance in a flower. He
                                    is the lord of devas. </li>
                                    <li>0 excellent brahmin of good rites, He is called the nourisher because it is from Him the supreme Purusa Siva that the Prakrti, the different Tattvas from Mahat to
                                    the different Indriyas, Vigm, Brahma, the sages, Indra and
                                    the devas derive their nourishment.</li>
                                    <li>Worship that immortal deity Siva with sacred rites, penance, self-study of the Vedas, yogic practices, meditation, observance of truth and other means. You will be
                                    freed from the noose of Yama. The lord is the cause of both bondage and salvation.</li>
                                    <li>In my opinion this Mrtasanjivani mantra is the most excellent of all. Repeat these mantras regularly remembering Siva with devotion. After Japa, Homa and recitation of the mantras observe fast, but you can drink water
                                    day and night.· If the meditation is conducted in the presence of Siva there is no fear of death from anywhere.</li>
                                    <li>Nyasa and other ritualistic rites shall be observed. Siva shall be worshipped duly. Siva who is favourably disposed to his devotees shall be propitiated. I shall also
                                    mention the observance of meditation. It is after this meditation that the mantra shall be repeated as long as the purpose
                                    is realised due to Siva's power.</li>
                                    <li>I worship the three-eyed Lord Siva, the conqueror of death who is accompanied by(Parvati); who pours water on his head from two vessels held in his lotus-like hands, by means
                                    of the other pair of hands; who has placed the two hands with the pots on the lap; who usually holds in his hands the rudraksha garland and a deer and whose body 'is rendered cool and wet by the nectar exuding from the moon worn
                                    qn the head. </li>

                                     31. Then, in order to confound the sage Dadhica,
                                     clever in the use of illusion, became multi-formed.
                                     32. In that body of the most excellent brahmin

                                     son of Cyavana spoke to the all-pervading, unborn,
                                     lord of the universe, eulogised by the whole universe.
                                     Dadhica said:-
                                     35. 0 long-armed one, cast-off this illusion. On consideration, this is only a sham appearance. 0 thousands of inscrutable things are known to me also.

                                     40. On hearing the words of the sage, the fearless
                                     became angry with the sage who had been infused
                                     with the brilliance of Siva.
                                     41. The gods also rushed to the aid of lord

                                     gods from fighting. Even after hearing my words, the defeated did not go near the sage, nor bowed to her.
                                     44. who became agitated and distressed went
                                     near Dadhica the great sage, bowed to him and requested
                                     thus.

                                     and the devas.
                                     Dadhica said :-

                                     said-"0 leader of kings, a brahmin is worthy of being
                                     respected by devas, kings and the best of other castes.
                                     50. 0 leader of kings, only brahmins are powerful,
                                     and influential". After saying thus clearly the brahmin
                                     entered his hermitage.
                                     51. After venerating Dadhica, returned to his
                                     abode, also returned to his region and the devas to
                                     their respective places.
                                     52. That place became a sanctified holy centre named
                                     Sthanesvara335• Persons making pilgrimage to Sthanesvara
                                     will attain the Sayujya salvation with Siva.
                                     53. Thus I have briefly narrated the dispute between
                                     and Dadhica and also the story of Brahma and
                                     who were cursed for being without the support of Siva.
                                     54. Whoever recites this portion containing the discord
                                     between and Dadhica can conquer premature death.
                                     After death he attains Brahma's region.
                                     55. If a person recites this section and enters the battle,
                                     he need not be afraid of death at all. He will come out
                                     victorious. </li>

                                    is the lord of devas. </li>
                                    <li>0 excellent brahmin of good rites, He is called the nourisher because it is from Him the supreme Purusa Siva that the Prakrti, the different Tattvas from Mahat to
                                    the different Indriyas, Vigm, Brahma, the sages, Indra and
                                    the devas derive their nourishment.</li>
                                    <li>Worship that immortal deity Siva with sacred rites, penance, self-study of the Vedas, yogic practices, meditation, observance of truth and other means. You will be
                                    freed from the noose of Yama. The lord is the cause of both bondage and salvation.</li>
                                    <li>In my opinion this Mrtasanjivani mantra is the most excellent of all. Repeat these mantras regularly remembering Siva with devotion. After Japa, Homa and recitation of the mantras observe fast, but you can drink water
                                    day and night.· If the meditation is conducted in the presence of Siva there is no fear of death from anywhere.</li>
                                    <li>Nyasa and other ritualistic rites shall be observed. Siva shall be worshipped duly. Siva who is favourably disposed to his devotees shall be propitiated. I shall also
                                    mention the observance of meditation. It is after this meditation that the mantra shall be repeated as long as the purpose
                                    is realised due to Siva's power.</li>
                                    <li>I worship the three-eyed Lord Siva, the conqueror of death who is accompanied by(Parvati); who pours water on his head from two vessels held in his lotus-like hands, by means
                                    of the other pair of hands; who has placed the two hands with the pots on the lap; who usually holds in his hands the rudraksha garland and a deer and whose body 'is rendered cool and wet by the nectar exuding from the moon worn
                                    qn the head. </li>

                                     5. On hearing that, I was extremely pained for my
                                     son In that mental anguish I thought.

                                    <li>Lord Siva is the essence, the fragrance of the  three Tattvas, three fires, of every thing that is trichotomised, of the three worlds, of the three arms and of the trinity. He
                                    is the nourisher. In all living beings, everywhere, in the three GUnas, in the creation, in the sense-organs, in the devas and Ganas, he is the essence as the fragrance in a flower. He
                                    is the lord of devas. </li>

                                    freed from the noose of Yama. The lord is the cause of both bondage and salvation.</li>
                                    <li>In my opinion this Mrtasanjivani mantra is the most excellent of all. Repeat these mantras regularly remembering Siva with devotion. After Japa, Homa and recitation of the mantras observe fast, but you can drink water

                                     1. 0 great lord, the lord of the gods and the prescriber of worldly conventions, we know you to be Siva and
                                     Brahman, thanks to your favour. 
                                     Rudrasamhitii 461
                                     2. 0 lord Siva, why do you delude us by your illusion
                                     which is inscrutable and which deludes people always.
                                     3. You are the supreme Brahman, greater than Prak:rti
                                     and the material and activating cause of the universe.
                                     You are incomprehensible and inexpressible.
                                     4. You alone create, sustain and annihilate the universe
                                     under your control like a spider (weaving its web). You
                                     sport about with Sivasakti-your own manifestation.
                                     5. 0 Siva, merciful that you are, you alone created the
                                     sacrifice through for the fulfilment of the Vedas.
                                     6. The delimitations which brahmins, experts in the
                                     Vedic path and rituals, believe in, end with you in the world.
                                     7. 0 lord, the activities of auspicious nature result
                                     in happiness to the doer whereas inauspicious activities end
                                     in adverse, or in partially good and bad results.
                                     8. You alone are the bestower of the fruits of all
                                     actions. You are the lord of glorious things according to
                                     the Vedas.
                                     9. Vulgar persons who observe sacrificial rites alone
                                     are acrimonious and wicked. With harsh words and jealousy these deluded persons inflict pain on others.
                                     10. , 0 lord, let not the destruction of these gods be
                                     carried out by you. 0 lord, great god, be merciful.
                                     11. Obeisance to Siva who is calm, the supreme and
                                     the highest soul, of matted hair, great lord and the bright
                                     one.
                                     12. You are the creator of the creators of the universe.
                                     You are the sustainer and the forefather, possessed of three
                                     attributes and attributeless. You are greater than primordial nature and the supreme Being.
                                     13. Obeisance to Thee the blue-necked, the creator,
                                     the supreme soul, the universe, the speed of the universe
                                     and the cause of the bliss of the universe.
                                     14. You are Orhkara, the initiator of
                                     enterprises, Hantakara, Svadhakara * and the partaker of

                                     casts the oblation offered to the deity into the fire.
                                     . *Hantakara and Svadhakara are particular formulas of benediction.
                                     In the present context the Hantakara and Svadbikara are personified and described as identical with Siva.

                                     Havya and Kavya offerings always.
                                     15. 0 righteous one, how is it that the sacrifice has
                                     been broken by you? 0 great God, you are a benefactor of
                                     brahmins. 0 lord, how can you be a destroyer of sacrifi.cers?
                                     16. You are the protector of virtue, brahmins and cows.
                                     0 lord, you are the shelter for all living beings and worthy
                                     of being bowed to.
                                     17. Obeisance to you, 0 lord, having the splendour of

                                     1. Lord Siva was delighted on being conciliated and
                                     cajolled by Vi!?J?.U, Brahma and the sages.
                                     2. Consoling Vig1u and other devas and laughing,
                                     the merciful lord Siva blessed them and spoke.
                                     Lord Siva said :-
                                     3. 0 excellent devas, both of you listen with attention.
                                     0 dear ones, I shall state the truth. I have always borne
                                     your wrath.
                                     4. I do not take into account the sin committed by
                                     my children. I have inflicted punishment on those who are
                                     afflicted by my illusion.
                                     5. The destruction of the sacrifice of was not
                                     done by me. If a person hates another, ultimately it recoils
                                     on him alone.
                                     6. No action that involves the affliction of others will
                                     be indulged in by me at any time. If anyone hates another
                                     · it will recoil on him alone.
                                     7. Let the head (the sacrificial head) of Dak!?a be
                                     that of a goat. Let the god Bhaga receive his share in the
                                     . sacrifice in conjunction with the sun.
                                     8. 0 dear ones, the god who used to grip the
                                     cooked offerings in a sacrifice with his teeth has been rendered broken-toothed and will remain as such. I have
                                     spoken the truth.
                                     9. Bhrgu who opposed me shall become goat-bearded.
                                     The gods who tried to uproot me shall have their physical
                                     bodies.
                                     1 0. Let the Adhvaryu priests be borne through the
                                     arms of Asvins and the hands of I have. spoken thus
                                     out of love for you .
                                     . Brahma said:-
                                     . ·11.. Saying, thus, the lord though :merciful, yet ·or

                                     12. On hearing his speech, Vigm and other gods were
                                     delighted and sent out cries of approbation.
                                     13-14. Then at the invitation of and other gods,
                                     Siva went to Kanakhala at the sacrificial altar of
                                     The celestial sages and I too accompanied him
                                     there.
                                     15. Then Rudra saw the extent of destruction carried
                                     out by Virabhadra, of the sacrifice and of the celestial sages.
                                     16-17. Svaha, Svadha, Dhrti, Sarasvati,
                                     the the manes, Agnis, many others like Gandharvas, who were mutilated, wounded or killed in

                                     18. 04 seeing this destruction of the sacrifice, He
                                     called the of Gal).as, Virabhadra of great virility
                                     and spoke to him.
                                     19. 0 Virabhadra of powerful arms, what is it that
                                     you have done ? 0 dear, in your hurry you have inflicted very severe punishment on the celestial sages and
                                     others.
                                     20. Bring here quickly. 0 dear, he performed
                                     a sacrifice contrary to rules, whence this result arose.
                                     Brahmii said :-
                                     21. Thus commanded by Siva, Virabhadra, hastened to
                                     bring the headless body of which he threw in front
                                     of Siva.
                                     22-23. 0 excellent sage, on seeing the headless bedy,
                                     Siva, the benefactor of the worlds, spoke laughingly to

                                     re,plied-''0 ler:d Siva, at that time itself, the head was

                                     24-26. On hearing the wards of Siva
                                     comr;ni;!.-nded the gods in the manner as mentio:aed
                                     After doing in accordance with what lord Siva had s.aid,
                                     the gods and I acquainted Bhrgu with the same quickly •
                                     . At the bidding of Siva, they immediately joinecl. the head
                                     of the saGr:i&Cial 'animal, the goat1 with the 'bady of 
                                     Rutlrasamhitll
                                     27. When the head was joined and Siva. looked aJtdt,
                                     regained his life and awoke as if from sleep.
                                     28. On waking up he saw Siva, the merciful, in fi:otJ.t
                                     of him. stood there happy and joyful.
                                     29. Formerly his mind had been contaminated and
                                     affected by a great hatred towards Siva. But now immedia ..
                                     tely after seeing him, his mind became pure like the autumnal moon.
                                     30. He wanted to . eulogise Siva but could not do so
                                     because of his affection, emotional disturbance and anxiety
                                     for his deceased daughter.
                                     31. Then after regaining composure and peace of
                                     mind, the ashamed bowed and eulogised Si:va, the
                                     benefactor of the worlds.
                                     said :-
                                     32. I bow to the great lord, the supreme being; the

                                     bow to Siva, the lord of the chief of Gods, always conferring
                                     happiness and the sole kinsman of the universe.
                                     33. I bow to the lord of the universe, of cosmic form,
                                     the· primordial Being and the form of Brahman itse-lf.

                                     you before. He has committed an offence making us meritless. 0 great lord, Thou must forgive him since thou art

                                     47. 0 Siva, out of delusion. I too have committed
                                     offence against you since I took sides with and fought
                                     with Virabhadra, Thy attendant.
                                     48. 0 Sadasiva, Thou art my master, the supreme
                                     Brahman. I am Thy slave. I shall be sustained by Thee
                                     always since thou art the father unto us all.
                                     Brahma said :-
                                     49. 0 great lord, lord of devas, 0 lord, 0 ocean of
                                     mercy, Thou art the independent great soul, the great Siva,
                                     and without a second.

                                     granting him a body. Thou dost not mind the offence to
                                     Thee. Resuscitate the sacrifice of
                                     51. 0 Lord of gods, be Remove all curses.
                                     Thou art my conscious encourager. Thou alone art the

                                     52. 0 great sage, after thus eulogising lord Siva, I
                                     joined my palms in reverence and bent my head in
                                     humility.
                                     53. Then Indra and other gods, the guardians of the
                                     quarters, of good mentality lauded lord Siva whose lotuslike face beamed with brilliance.
                                     54. The other gods too of delighted minds, the Siddhas,
                                     the sages and the Prajapatis lauded Siva joyously.
                                     55. Then the gods of lower rank, Nagas, and the
                                     brahmins, the members of the assembly, bowed with devotion
                                     and eulogised Siva severally.

                                    <li>We worship the three-eyed lord Siva, the lord of the three worlds, the father of the three spheres, the lord of the three gunas.</li>
                                    <li>Lord Siva is the essence, the fragrance of the  three Tattvas, three fires, of every thing that is trichotomised, of the three worlds, of the three arms and of the trinity. He
                                    is the nourisher. In all living beings, everywhere, in the three GUnas, in the creation, in the sense-organs, in the devas and Ganas, he is the essence as the fragrance in a flower. He
                                    is the lord of devas. </li>
                                    <li>0 excellent brahmin of good rites, He is called the nourisher because it is from Him the supreme Purusa Siva that the Prakrti, the different Tattvas from Mahat to
                                    the different Indriyas, Vigm, Brahma, the sages, Indra and
                                    the devas derive their nourishment.</li>
                                    <li>Worship that immortal deity Siva with sacred rites, penance, self-study of the Vedas, yogic practices, meditation, observance of truth and other means. You will be
                                    freed from the noose of Yama. The lord is the cause of both bondage and salvation.</li>
                                    <li>In my opinion this Mrtasanjivani mantra is the most excellent of all. Repeat these mantras regularly remembering Siva with devotion. After Japa, Homa and recitation of the mantras observe fast, but you can drink water
                                    day and night.· If the meditation is conducted in the presence of Siva there is no fear of death from anywhere.</li>
                                    <li>Nyasa and other ritualistic rites shall be observed. Siva shall be worshipped duly. Siva who is favourably disposed to his devotees shall be propitiated. I shall also
                                    mention the observance of meditation. It is after this meditation that the mantra shall be repeated as long as the purpose

                                     gods by His benign glance, Siva spoke to
                                     Lord Siva said :-
                                     3. 0 Dak:?a, listen. I shall explain. 0 patriarch, I
                                     am delighted. Although I am independent lord of all, I am
                                     subservient to my devotees always.
                                     "4. Four kinds of meritorious persons worship me
                                     always. 0 patriarch the latter are greater than the
                                     former.
                                     5. They are-the distressed, the inquisitive, the
                                     fortune-seeker and the wise. The first three are ordinary
                                     and the fourth one is extraordinary person.

                                     6. The wise among these four is a great favourite of
                                     mine. He is of my own form. None is dearer to me than
                                     the wise. It is the truth. I tell you the truth.
                                     7. I am the knower of Self. I can be known through
                                     knowledge by those who have mastered Vedanta and the
                                     Vedds.
                                     8. Deluded men engrossed in rituals alone cannot
                                     attain me through the Vedas, sacrifices, gifts or austerities.
                                     9. You wished to cross the ocean of worldly existence
                                     by observance of rituals alone. That was why I became
                                     angry and caused the destruction of the sacrifice.
                                     I 0. Hereafter, 0 thinking upon me as the great
                                     Lord apd giving more importance to knowledge you carry
                                     on rituals with care and attention.
                                     11.. 0 patriarch, listen to another statement of mine
                                     with· a clear conscience. Although it is based on the
                                     qualitative aspect it is esoteric. For the sak;e of virtue I
                                     shall tell you.
                                     12. Brahma, Vigm and I constitute the chief cause of
                                     the universe. But I am the soul, the witness, self-seer and
                                     without attributes.
                                     13. 0 sage, entering into my own illusion consisting
                                     of three attributes, I create, sustain and annihilate the
                                     universe and acquire designations consistent with the
                                     activities.
                                     14. In that supreme, sole, universal God which is the
                                     pure Self, the ignorant sees different living beings, Brahman,
                                     Isvara etc.
                                     15, Even as an ordinary man does not consider his
                                     head, hands and other limbs as separate from his own self
                                     so also my follower does not feel separateness about the
                                     living beings.
                                     16. He attains peace, who does not see any difference
                                     among the three deities who constitute the soul of all
                                     living beings and who have the same innate property, 0
                                     17. The base man who differentiates the deities of
                                     the Trini ty34.s ·certainly stays in hell as long as, the- moon

                                     and the stars shine.
                                     18. My devotee may worship the gods. Being so
                                     absorbed he will attain knowledge leading to ·eternal
                                     salvation.
                                     19. Without devotion to Brahma one cannot have the
                                     devotion to Vigl.U; without devotion to none will
                                     have devotion towards me.
                                     20. After saying this, Siva, the great lord, the
                                     merciful god spoke these words within the hearing of
                                     everyone.
                                     21. "lf a devotee of hates me or if a devotee
                                     of Siva hates both will incur curses and never realise
                                     reality".
                                     Bra.hmii said :-
                                     22. On hearing these pleasing words of lord Siva, 0
                                     sage, the devas, sages and others were greatly delighted.
                                     With great joy, his family and the gods
                                     realised Siva as the lord of all and was engrossed in devotion
                                     to Siva. Lord Siva who was delighted in mind granted boons
                                     to all, as he received reverence to His great self.
                                     25. Permitted by Siva and with his blessings, 0 sage,
                                     the devotee of Siva, with a delighted heart completed
                                     his sacrifice.
                                     26. He allotted the full share to Siva and gave the gods
                                     their respective shares. He gave charitable gifts to the
                                     brahmins and secured the good blessings of Siva.
                                     27. Thus the patriarch, in collaboration with
                                     the completed that great rite of the gods in accordance
                                     with the sacred jnjunction.
                                     28. 0 excellent sage, thus the sacrifice of was
                                     completed, thanks to the grace of Siva who is identical with
                                     the supreme Brahman.
                                     29. Then the celestial sages, sang the glory of Siva
                                     and left for their abodes with delighted minds. Others too
                                     were pleased and left for their homes.

                                     30. Vig1u and I, went to our regions, joyfully singing
                                     the ever auspicious glory of Siva.
                                     31. Lovingly honoured by the great lord Siva,
                                     the goal of the good, returned to Kailasa along with his
                                     GaJ;laS. He was greatly delighted.
                                     32. After returning to his mountain, Siva remembered

                                    <li>We worship the three-eyed lord Siva, the lord of the three worlds, the father of the three spheres, the lord of the three gunas.</li>

                                    is the nourisher. In all living beings, everywhere, in the three GUnas, in the creation, in the sense-organs, in the devas and Ganas, he is the essence as the fragrance in a flower. He
                                    is the lord of devas. </li>
                                    <li>0 excellent brahmin of good rites, He is called the nourisher because it is from Him the supreme Purusa Siva that the Prakrti, the different Tattvas from Mahat to

content: '<p>Narada, who was listening to the divine tales of Shiva with rapt attention, was very curious to know about the reasons why lord Vishnu attended a yagya where Shiva was not invited and why did he fight a battle against Veerbhadra despite knowing about his invincibility.  </p>' +
'<p>Lord Brahma told him that all this happened due to the curse of Sage Dadhichi-<br/>' +
'In the ancient times, there used to live a king named Kshuva, who was a great friend of Sage Dadhichi. Due to some reasons both of their developed animosity towards each other. Dadhichi considered himself superior because of being a brahmin, on the other hand Kshuva considered himself superior on account of his wealth. The dispute took a worst turn and Dadhichi punched him on his head. As a result Kshuva felt down unconscious. When he regained his consciousness he struck sage Dadhichi with his weapon named Vajra, which injured Dadhichi.</p>' +
'<p>Dadhichi sought the help of Shukracharya. Shukracharya healed his wounds by his mantras. He also taught Dadhichi the mahamrityunjay mantra. Dadhichi then did a tremendous penance to please lord Shiva. Lord Shiva appeared before him and blessed him with three boons, they were 1) his bones, would become as hard as lightning (Vajra), 2) he would not be killed, 3) he would never be humiliated.</p>' +
'<p>Armed with these three boons, Sage Dadhichi again went to fight Kshuva. He kicked him, in return Kshuva too attacked him with his weapon named Vajra, but it did not have any effect on Dadhichi as his bones had become as hard as lighting.</p>' +
'<p>King Kshuva did a tremendous penance to please lord Vishnu. Vishnu revealed to him that Dadhichi had become immortal because of the blessings of lord Shiva, but assured him that he would certainly help him in defeating Dadhichi.</p>' +
'<p>Lord Vishnu then visited the hermitage of Sage Dadhichi, disguised as a brahmin. On being asked by Dadhichi about the purpose of his arrival, he said that he had come with a desire of a boon on his heart.</p>' +
'<p>Sage Dadhichi, by his yogic power came to know about the real identity of a \'Brahmin\'. He told that he had been caught. Lord Vishnu was ashamed.</p>' +
'<p>Lord Vishnu then went back to Kshuva and instructed him to go to sage Dadhichi and act as if he had accepted his superiority.</p>' +
'<p>"Kshuva went to sage Dadhichi and did as he was instructed to do, but Dadhichi did not believe his words. Now lord Vishnu became angry and tried to kill him by his sudarshan chakra, but he was not successful, as the chakra, which was given to him by lord Shiva himself, was not willing to harm a devotee of Shiva. "Lord Vishnu then tried to kill Dadhichi by shooting volley of arrows. The deities too attacked with their weapon. Sage Dadhichi threw a handful of Kusha grass, initiated with mantras towards them, which destroyed all the weapons of the deities."</p>' +
'<p>"In the meantime lord Brahma arrived on the scene accompanies by Kshuva. He told the deities that it was futile to fight with Dadhichi as he was invincible, due to the boon given by lord Shiva."  </p>' +
'<p>"Ultimately King Kshuva begged his forgiveness for his offence. Dahichi forgave him but cursed Vishnu including all the deities that they would be burnt to ashes by the wrath of Rudra." "This was the reason why all the deities and lord Vishnu attended the yagya, organised by Daksha and got defeated by Veerbhadra."</p>' ,
