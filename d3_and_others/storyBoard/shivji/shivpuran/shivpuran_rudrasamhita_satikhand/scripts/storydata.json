<ol><li>0 Brahma, thanks to Siva's favour, you know everything. You have narrated to me the wonderful stories of Siva and Parvati.</li>
<li>0 lord, I am never fully satiated by hearing the great story of Siva from your lotus-like face. I wish to hear further the same.</li>
<li>As explained by you, Rudra is the complete manifestation of Siva. He is the great Lord whose abode is Kailasa. He is a yogin of perfect control. 
He is worthy of being propitiated by all devas, and ·others. He is the final goal of all good men. 
He is free from Dvandvas (mutually clashing opposites). The great lord never undergoes any change yet indulges in His divine sports.. 
He became a· householder again after marrying the noble lady Mangala at the request of when she performed penance. 
At first she was born of and later of Himalaya. How could she be the daughter of both with the same body? How did Sati<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (233)</note> become Parvati and attain Siva again?

<li>0 best of sages, dear one, listen. I shall narrate the auspicious story on· hearing which undoubtedly the life will become fruitful.</li>
<li>Formerly, on seeing my daughter Sandhya<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (234)</note> in the company of my sons I was afflicted by the arrows of the cupid and much upset.</li>
<li>When remembered by Dharma, Rudra, the highest lord and the greatest yogin came there. He reproached me as well as my sons and went back to His abode.</li>
<li>A serious offence was committed by me against Siva the great lord, by whose Maya I was subjected to great delusion despite my being the reciter of the Vedas.</li>
<li>Under great delusion and goaded by the envious feelings towards the lord I conspired with my sons to find out ways and means to delude the lord Himself. Here again I was deluded by Siva's Maya.</li>
<li>0 great sage, in Siva the great lord, all those ways and means pursued by me and my sons became in- effective.</li>
<li>When my strategy failed I remembered the lord of ( in the company of my sons. The intelligent
lord of Laxmi (Visnu) devoted to Siva came there and advised me.</li>
<li>Instructed by Visnu who demonstrated Siva's
principles, I cast off my envy no doubt, but since I still was· under delusion I did not eschew my stubbornness.</li>
<li>I humbly served Sakti and when she was pleased I created her as the daughter of and Asikni ( 's wife) . you remember, .was my son. This was my endeavour to make Hara enamoured of her.
</li>
<li>The goddess Uma became daughter, performed a severe penance and thanks to her great devotion became Rudra's wife. The goddess indeed is a benefactress of her devotees.</li>
<li>In the company of Uma, Rudra became a householder and the great lord performed divine sports. He of undecaying intellect deluded me even at the time of his marriage.</li>
<li>The independent lord assuming his own body married her and returned to his mountain. In her company he sported much, deluding many.</li>
<li>0 sage, much time was happily spent by Siva free from all depraved feelings and indulging in noble dalliance with her.</li>
<li>Then a feeling of rivalry arose between Daksa and Rudra; was excessively deluded by Siva's illusion and so becoming extremly haughty he censured the quiet Siva who was free from all depraved feelings.</li>
<li>Then the haughty, performed a sacrifice without Siva, although he had invited me and all other devas.</li>
<li>Since he was in delusion he was very furious. So he did not invite Rudra and his own daughter Sati. He was greatly deluded by his own fate.</li>
<li>When she was not invited by her father whose· mind was deluded by illusion, Siva ( Sati) of perfect knowledge and purest chastity played a divine sport.</li>
<li>Though not invited by her haughty father she did go to her father's house securing the reluctant permission of Siva.</li>
<li>Seeing no share of Rudra set apart and being slighted by her father, she all those who were present there and cast off her body.</li>
<li>On hearing that, lord Siva became unbearably furious and pulling at his matted hair he created Virabhadra.<noteref3_note3footer>(3) - (235)</note></li>
<li>When he was created along with attendants he began asking "What shall I do?". The entire annihilation of sacrifice and the disgrace of every one present
there was the order issued by Siva.</li>
<li>The lord of the Gal).as (Virabhadra) accompanied by his soldiers reached the place immediately after receiving the orders.</li>
<li>They worked a great havoc there. Virabhadra chastised everyone and spared none.</li>
<li>After defeating and the Devas with strenuc:>us effort, the chief of Ganas cut off the head of and consigned it to the sacrificial fire.</li>
<li>Working great havoc he destroyed the sacrifice. Then he came back to the mountain and bowed to Lord Siva.</li>
<li>Even as the whole of the world of Devas was witnessing, the process of destruction of the sacrifice was carried out by Virabhadra and others, the followers of Rudra.</li>
<li>The policy in agreement with what is laid down in the Vedas and Smrtis is this, 0 Sage, which you must note. When lord Rudra is angry, how can there be happiness in the world ?</li>
<li>On hearing his song of praise Rudra relented. Favourably disposed to the miserable that he was, he granted their request.</li>
<li>Siva, the great lord, indulging in different sorts of divine sports, became sympathetic and merciful as before.</li>
<li>Daksa was resuscitated. The whole sacrifice was renewed under the instruction of the merciful Lord Siva. All those present were honoured in due manner.</li>
<li>0 sage, in that sacrifice Rudra was honoured by all the Gods with due devotion. They were highly delighted.</li>
<li>The flame of fire arising from the body of Sati and delighting the whole world fell on that mountain and it was duly worshipped.</li>
<li>The deity became famous as Jvaliimukhi yielding fruits of cherished desires. Even her very vision quells all sins.</li>
<li>Even now she is worshipped with due festivities for the acquisition of all desires, observing all stipulated modes of procedure.</li>
<li>The Goddess Sati became the daughter of Himalaya. As such she became famous as Parvati.</li>
<li>She propitiated lord Siva with a rigorous penance and attained him as her husband.</li>
<li>0 great sage, I have narrated to you all that you asked me. Whoever hears this narrative will no doubt be freed from all sins.</li>

`233. Sati, the daughter of the son of Brahma, was married to Siva. She abandoned her body in consequence of the quarrel between her husband and father. It is said in the Purar;tas that Daksa instituted a sacrifice but apportioned no share to Siva. Thereupon Sati 'felt insulted
and entered the sacrificial fire whereupon Siva sent hundreds and thousands of powerful Gar;tas who destroyed the sacrifice and beheaded The :gresent section narrates the story of the birth of Sati, her marriage with Siva, their lovely sports and her tragic end at the sacrifice of her father, Daksa.`,
`234.Sandhya 'lit. twilight' is personified as the .daughter .. of Brahma. It is said tliat Brahma attempted to do violence to her but was reproached by Siva. According to another version Sandhya changed herself to a deer for escape from the evil intention of Brahma whereupon Brahma assumed the form of a stag and pursued her through the sky. Siva saw this and shot an arrow which cut off the head of the·stag. Brahma ·then reassumed his own form and paid homage to Siva,`,
`235.Virabhadra is described as son, produced from Siva's
matted locks or mouth or a drop of Siva's sweat in order to spoil .the i sacrifice of He is represented as havin'g a thousand heads, a

"Before jumping into the sacrificial fire, just remember anybody, whom you want as your husband, and your wish would be fulfilled in your next birth, when you would take birth as a daughter of Daksha Prajapati.

Now lord Vishnu became angry and tried to kill him by his sudarshan chakra, but he was not successful, as the chakra, which was given to him by lord Shiva himself, was not willing to harm a devotee of Shiva. "Lord Vishnu then tried to kill Dadhichi by shooting volley of arrows. The deities too attacked with their weapon. Sage Dadhichi threw a handful of Kusha grass, initiated with mantras towards them, which destroyed all the weapons of the deities."</p>' +
'<p>"In the meantime lord Brahma arrived on the scene accompanies by Kshuva. He told the deities that it was futile to fight with Dadhichi as he was invincible, due to the boon given by lord Shiva."  </p>' +
'<p>"Ultimately King Kshuva begged his forgiveness for his offence. Dahichi forgave him but cursed Vishnu including all the deities that they would be burnt to ashes by the wrath of Rudra." "This was the reason why all the deities and lord Vishnu attended the yagya, organised by Daksha and got defeated by Veerbhadra."</p>' ,

'<p>Brahma became very sad. To bring Daksha back to life and to accomplish the still unfinished yagya, he went to lord Vishnu to take his help. All the deities accompanied him. Lord Vishnu told them that it was wrong on the part of Daksha to have shown disrespect to Shiva. The deities were wrong to support him. Lord Vishnu then went to Kailash mountain, accompanied by Lord Brahma and all the other deities. All of them eulogized and worshipped Shiva. They also requested him to bring Daksha back to life.</p>' +
'<p>Lord Shiva became very pleased and agreed to make Daksha alive. All of them went to Kanakhal where Daksha had organised the yagya ceremony. Veerbhadra accompanied them. When they reached the site, Lord Shiva could not hold his laughter after seeing the destruction of the site. Anyway, he joined the head of a goat to the torso of Daksha\'s body and made him alive. He also compensated for all the losses which had been caused by the destruction. All the deities became very pleased and they eulogised Shiva.</p>' +
'<p>Becoming pleased by the invocation and eulogy of the deities, Lord Shiva preached Daksha in the following way-</p>' +
'<p>"The person who has the right knowledge (jnani) is the supreme among all human beings. An action which is performed in one\'s ignorance and jealousy does not liberate a man from his world bondages.</p>' +
'<p>O Daksha then accomplished his yagya singing the praise of lord Shiva. He also give lots of donation to the brahmins. They everybody returned to their respective houses being fully satisfied.</p>' +
'<p>Sati, the daughter of Daksha was reborn as Gauri, the daughter of Himalaya and Maina. By her tremendous penance she again had lord Shiva as her husband. </p>' ,
