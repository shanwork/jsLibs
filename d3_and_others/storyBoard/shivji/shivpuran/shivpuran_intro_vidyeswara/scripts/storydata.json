'<li>In the city of Kiratas there lived a brahmin extremely poor and deficient in (brahmanical) knowledge. He used to sell various kinds of beverage and was averse to the worship of gods or to virtuous ac tivities.</li>' +
'<li>He never practised the daily Sandhya prayers or ablutions. His practice resembled a Vaisya\'s mode of living. He never hesitated to deceive credulous persons. His name  was Devaraja.</li>' +

'<li>Thus by foul means much wealth was later accumulated by him. But the sinner that he was, not even the slightest part of his wealth was utilised in virtuous acts .</li>' +
'<li>Once that brahmin went to a lake to take his bath. There he saw a harlot called Sobhavati and was much agitated at her sight.</li>' +
'<li>The beautiful woman was extremely delighted on coming to know that a rich brahmin had become her willing slave. The brahmin\'s heart was filled with love due to her pleasant talk.</li>' +
'<li>He decided to make her his wife and she consented to have him as her husband. Thus in mutual love they sported for a long time.</li>' +
'<li>Sitting, lying, eating, drinking and playing together they were not at all different from any other wedded couple.</li>' +
'<li> Dissuaded again and· again by his mother, father, first wife and others though he was, he never paid heed to their words but continued his sinful activities.</li>' +
'<li> Once he became so enraged as to kill his mother, father and wedded wife at dead of night while they were asleep and took possession of their wealth.</li>' +
'<li>Enamoured of the courtesan he handed over to her his own wealth and also the wealth that he looted from his father, mother and first wife.</li>' +
'<li> In the company of this harlot he used to eat all sorts of forbidden food, became an addict to wine and spirituous liquors and partook of his food from the same plate as his concubine.</li>' +
'<li>Once, by chance, he came to the city of Pratisthana.<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (13)</note>  He saw a Siva temple where saintly men had congregated.</li>' +

He was bound with nooses</li>'+ '<li>In the mean while Siva\'s attendants dressed in white, smeared with ashes all over the body, wearing garlands of Rudraksha and wielding tridents in their hands started furiously from Sivaloka and reached Yama\'s city. They threatened the attendants of Yama (the God of death) and thrashed them. Releasing Devaraja from their clutches they seated him in a wonderful aerial chariot. When they wereabout to start to Kailasa a great tumult arose in the middle of Yama\'s city on hearing which Dharmaraja (the God of Death) himself came out of his palace.</li>' + '<li>  On seeing the four messengers who appeared like replicas of Rudra Himself, Dharmaraja the knower of virtues honoured them in accordance with the custom.</li>' +

'<li>I shall explain to you that great object attached to the glorification of Siva whereby your course hereafter will be pleasant always.</li>' +
'<li>It is by listening to the excellent story that your mind The glory of Sivapurana has now turned to the pure path of repentance and detachment towards worldly pleasures.</li>' +
'<li>Repentance is the only is the only way of acquittance for all sinners.Saintly men have extolled it as the only way of expiation for all sins.</li>' +
'<li>Purity can be realised by repentence alone. If the sinner expiates in the manner advised by saintly men it removes all sins.</li>' +
'<li>After due expiation he becomes free from fear. By repentance he attains salvation undoubtedly.</li>' +
'<li>The mental purity that one derives on hearing the story of Sivapurana cannot be gained by any other means.</li>' +
'<li>As a mirror bec~mes free from dirt on being wiped with a cloth, so is the mind undoubtedly purified by listening to this story.</li>' +
'<li>Accompanied by Amba, Siva stays in the minds of pure men. The sanctified soul thereupon attains the region of Siva and Amba.</li>' +
'<li> Hence this story is the means of realising the fourfold aim of life. It is for this that Mahadeva earnestly created this.</li>' +
'<li> Listening to the story of Parvati\'s consort (Siva) brings about steady contemplation. Contemplation leads to perfect knowledge which certainly brings in salvation.</li>' +
'<li> A person who listens to the story in this birth though he be unable to meditate, realises the same in the next birth after which he reaches the goal of Siva</li>' +
'<li>Many repentant sinners have meditated upon Siva after hearing this story and have achieved salvation.</li>' +
'<li> Listening to the excellent story is the cause of beatitude for all men. Properly entertained, it dispels the ailment of worldly bondage.</li>' +
'<li> Listening to the story of Siva, constant meditations thereon and repeated musings certainly purify the mind.</li>' +
'<li> That (the purity of the mind) leads the meditator to a devotion of Mahesha and his two sons (Ganesa and Kartikeya). With their blessings one undoubtedly attains liberation</li>' +
'<li>A person ·devoid of that devotion with his mind  entangled in the bondage of ignorance is a brute. He. can never be liberated from the worldly bondage.</li>' +
'<li>Hen,ce 0 Brahmin lady, you turn away from worldly pleasures. Listen to the sanctifying story of Siva with devotion.</li>' +
'<li>Your mind, as you listen to the excellent story of Siva, the Supreme Soul, will become pure and thereafter you will realise liberation.</li>' +

'<li>News must be circulated in different localities that the auspicious discourse is to take place and all who seek welfare must be present. </li>'+
'<li>Women, Sudra and others who are far removed from holy discourses and stay away from singing glories of Siva shall attend this discourse whence they may have some enlightenment.</li>'+
'<li>Wherever there are devotees of Siva, eager to listen to the songs of praise in the neighbourhood, they must also be invited with due reverence. </li>' +
'<li>Thus there shall be a great festive gathering of saintly men at the discourse of Sivapural).a, a wonderful con· gregation. </li>' +
'<li>With devotion, may all of you be pleased to join us for imbibing the sweet juice of Sivapurana, with due reverence. </li>' +
'<li>If you do not have sufficient leisure, please grace the assembly at least for a day. By all means, do come, even for a short stay or a while. </li>' +
'<li>Thus all should be invited humbly. Those who all come should be hospitably received in all respects. </li>' +
'<li>An excellent spot for the discourse on Sivapurana must be selected in a temple of Siva, or in a holy centre or in a park or in a private house.</li>' +
'<li>The ground must be scrubbed, cleaned and smeared with cowdung. It must. be decorated with metallic materials attended with all festivities. The whole arrangement must be divinely exquisite and pleasing to diverse tastes. </li>' +
'<li>All the rubbish must be removed and all unnecessary things must be hidden in a corner away from the public v1ew. </li>' +
'<li>A high platform must be constructed, richly decorated with stumps of plantain trees. The whole place should be covered with a canopy. Fruits and flowers should be profusely used. </li>' +
'<li>Flags and banners should be hoisted in the four quarters. They should be neatly arranged to be pleasing to everyone. </li>' +
'<li>A seat must be assigned to Siva, the Supreme soul. A comfortable seat shall be assigned to the orator. </li>' +
'<li>Good places shall be reserved for the regular listeners as befitting their position. 0 sage, for the other casual visitors, seats with ordinary comfort shall be set apart. </li>' +
'<li>People must be in as pleasant a mood as on marriage occasions : all worldly worries and anxieties must be avoided. · </li>' +
'<li>The discourser faces the north and the listeners the east. There is no fear of the criss-crossings of the feet. </li>' +
'<li>Or· the discourser faces the east as the worshipper Or let the discourser and the recipient face each other. </li>' +
'<li>As long as he is seated in the seat of the discourser, the Puranist does not bow to any one before the conclusion of the discourse. </li>' +
'<li>Whether he is a boy or a youth, an old man, an indigent person, or a weakling, the scholar well-versed 1n the Purana is worthy of honour from all those who seek merit. </li>' +
'<li>Never shall anyone show demeaning disrespect towards a Purana-scholar, the speech from whose mouth is no less than the diyine cow Kamadhenu for all persons. </li>' +
'<li>Either as the cause ofbirth or of attributes there are many who may be termed "Guru" (Elder, preceptor). Among them the Pural)ic scholar is the greatest Guru. </li>' +
'<li>Who can be a greater Guru than the person who bestows the highest salvation on those who are disheartened due to the millions of births ? </li>' +
'<li>The person who undertakes to conduct a discourse on this sanctifying tale shall be well-versed in Pural).as, pure, skilful, quiet, free from malice, saintly, sympathetic and eloquent. </li>' +
'<li>The intelligent discourser shall start the narration of the story of Sivapurana at sunrise and continue it for two and a half Praharas (2.5 X 3=7.5! Hrs earnestly. </li>' +
'<li>This story shall not be narrated before rogues, wicked persons of crooked professions and those bent on conquering others in disputes and arguments. </li>' +
'<li>The discourse on this holy story shall not be conducted in a place infested by wicked men, or surrounded by thieves or in the house of a rogue. </li>' +
'<li>The orator shall have an interval of a Muhurta (forty-eight minutes) at midday for the sake of answering calls of nature. </li>' +
'<li>The discourser must have his share on the day previous to the discourse so that his vow be maintained. During the days of discourse he shall perform all his daily routine (Sandhya etc.) briefly.</li>' +
'<li>Another scholar equally well-versed in Puranas should be sitting near the discourser to help him. He must be competent to clear doubts and eager to enlighten the people. </li>' +
'<li>In order to ward off obstacles to the discourse, Ga~anatha<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (20)</note> should be worshipped. The lord of the story Siva and the book, Sivapurana, too must be worshipped with piety</li>' +
'<li>The story of Sivapurana must be listened to with careful attention. The recipient must be intelligent, pure in mind, delighted at the heart and a follower of conventions.</li>' +
'<li>If either the discourser or the recipient indulges in too many extraneous activities, is a victim of any of the six base feelings of lust, anger etc,<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (21)</note>  is enamoured of women or is a heretic he cannot gain any merit.</li>' +
'<li>Casting off the worries of worldly affairs and those of wealth, house and sons if any one of pure mind concentrates his attention on the discourse he will secure the excellent fruit. </li>' +
'<li>The recipients who are endowed with faith and piety, do not eagerly pursue other activities and are unruffled, pure and restrained in speech derive great merit. </li>' +
'<li>Base men of impious nature who listen to this holy story do not have any special merit derived out of it. They will have misery in every birth. </li>' +
'<li>Those who do not honour this Purana with presents according to their capacity are fools. Even if they listen to the story they will not be sanctified. They will become indigent. </li>' +
'<li>Those who walk out of congregation in the middle of the discourse will have the adverse effect: they will face the destruction of their wives and wealth in the midst of enjoyment. </li>' +
'<li>The sons and descendants of the people who attend the discourse with turbaned head, become sinners defiling the whole race. </li>' +
'<li>The attendants of Yama in hell force the people who chewed betel leaves while attending the discourse, to eat their own faeces. </li>' +
'<li>Those who listen to the story seated on a more elevated seat fall into hell and after undergoing the tortures there are reborn as crows. </li>' +
'<li>Those who listen to this auspicious story seated in the Vira pose<noteref3_note3footer>(3) - (22)</note> fall into hell and after undergoing the tortures of hell are reborn as poisonous plants. </li>' +
'<li>Those who listen to the story without bowing to the discourser at first fall into hell and after undergoing the tortures of hell are reborn as Arjuna trees. </li>' +
'<li>Those who, not being sick, listen to the story lying down, fall into hell and are reborn as pythons etc. </li>' +
'<li>Those who listen to the story seated on the same level as the discourser become as sinful as the defiler of the preceptor\'s bed and fall into hell. </li>' +
'<li>Those who speak ill of the discourser or of this sacred story are born as dogs and lead miserable lives in hundred births. </li>' +
'<li>Those who begin to argue and dispute while the discourse is being held fall in to hell and after undergoing the tortures there are reborn as donkeys. </li>' +
'<li>Those who never listen to this sanctifying story fall into hell. After experiencing the tortures there they are reborn as wild boars. </li>' +
'<li>The rogues who create hindrances even as the discourse is being held fall into hell. After undergoing the tortures there for millions of years they are reborn as village-boars. </li>' +
'<li>Realising all these, the listener shail always be pure, devoted to the discourser and intelligent enough to listen to the story with devotion. </li>' +
'<li>For warding off ~bstacles to the discourse Lord Ga:r;:tesa should be worshipped at first. Every day at the end of the discourse he shall briefly perform expiatory rites (for omissions and commissions). </li>' +
'<li>He shall worship the nine planets<noteref4_note4footer>(4) - (23)</note> and the deities in the "Sarvatobhadra" array. He shall worship the book according to the rites of Siva\'s adoration. </li>' +
'<li>At the conclusion of the worship he shall offer prayer to the book identified directly with Siva, humbly and piously joining his palms in reverence. </li>' +
'<li>(The Prayer)<ul><li> "Thou art the visible Mahesvara Srimat Sivapurana. Thou hast been accepted by me for listening purpose. Be thou pleased with me.</li><li>This wish of mine must be fulfilled by Thee. May this narration of the story be concluded without obstacles.</li><li>I am immersed in the middle of the ocean of worldly existence. Please lift me up from it, miserable wretch that I am, with my limbs caught in by the crocodiles of Karman (Action) : 0 Sankara, I am Thy slave." . </li></ul> The householder shall thus pray to Sivapurana identified directly with Siva, in words evoking pity. Then he shall begin the worship of the discourser. </li>' +
'<li>He shall adore the discourser too in the same manner as in the rite of the worship of Siva and propitiate him with flowers, cloths, ornaments, incense lamps etc. </li>' +
'<li>In the presence of the discourser he shall take vow and observe all restraints with a pure mind and the same shall be maintained till the conclusion to the extent of his capacity. </li>' +
'<li>"0 Thou,· the foremost of discoursers, identified with Vyasa, well-versed in the sacred literature of Siva, please remove my ignorance· through the light of this story." </li>' +
'<li>He shall invite five brahmins (if he can) or at least a brahmin for repeating Siva Pancarna mantra.<noteref5_note5footer>(5) - (24)</note></li>' +
'<li>Thus 0 sage, I have told you the rules of listening to the story _with devotion as well as those of governing the pious recipients. What else do you wish to hear ? </li></ol>' + '<br/><a href=\'#top\'><strong>Back To Top</strong></a></p>',

'<li>The devotee who takes up this rite shall take his daily meal only at the end of the daily discourse. He must observe Brahmacarya (celibacy) during those days. He must iie on the ground and take food only in the Patravalli (a number of leaves stitched together· to serve the purpose of a plate).</li>' +
'<li> The man who has the strength in abundance shall observe fast till the conclusion of the whole Purana and listen to the excellent Sivapurana with great devotion and purity. </li>' +
'<li>He may drink only milk or ghee throughout and listen to the story with pleasure. He may live on fruit diet or take a single meal or even eschew that and proceed with the listening rite. ·</li>' +
'<li>Or· he may take Havi~yanna (cooked rice soaked in ghee and sacrificially offered) once a day and maintain the rite. The diet part is according to convenience and comfort but the listening shall be strictly maintained.</li>' +
'<li>If there is more facility in hearing let the devotee take food. If observing fast causes hindrance to listening to the story it is not to be recommended.</li>' +
'<li>The householder taking the rite shall avoid heavy indigestible pulses like Nispava, Masiirika etc., stale food, defiled food, brinjals, gourds, radish, pumpkins, coconuts, garlic, onion, asafoetida, intoxicating beverages and all kinds of meat. </li>' +
'<li>He shall avoid the six base feelings of lust, anger etc., he shall not despise brahmins and bear ill will towards chaste ladies and good men. </li>' +
'<li>He shall not look at women in their menstrual period. He shall not converse with fallen people, nor talk to haters of brahmins or unbelievers in the Vedas. </li>' +
'<li>The house-holder shall practise and strictly adhere to truthfulness, purity, mercy, restraint in speech, straightforwardness, humility, liberalmindedness and other virtues. </li>' +
'<li>The householder may listen ,to the story with any specific desire cherished in his mind or absolutely free from any desire. If he has any desire it will be fulfilled; if he is free from desire he shall attain salvation. </li>' +
'<li>An indigent person, a consumptive, a sinner, an unfortunate person and a person having no child shall hear this excellent story. </li>' +
'<li>The seven types of wicked women like Kakavandhya (a woman having a single child) and those suffering from miscarriages shall hear this story. </li>' +
'<li>Whether women or men, all must hear the story of Sivapurana, 0 sage, in the manner prescribed. </li>' +
'<li>The days of discourse on Sivapurana must be considered very excellent, even on a par with millions of sacrifices. </li>' +
'<li>Gifts duly bestowed on these excellent days, even though they may not be much in quantity, yield everlasting benefit. </li>' +
'<li>Observing the rites thus, and listening to the great story the flourishing house-holder shall delightedly perform the Udyapana rite (at the end of completion). </li>' +
'<li>This Udyapana rite is on a par with the Caturdasi rite (observed on the fourteenth day of the lunar month) .. Rich men who wish to secure the fruits thereof must perform it likewise. </li>' +
'<li>Indigent devotees usually do not and need not perform the U dyapana rite. They are sanctified by the listening alone. Pious devotees of Siva are free from desires. </li>' +
'<li>After the festive celebration of the sacrifice of the discourse on Sivapurana is thus concluded, the listeners shall perform the worship. </li>' +
'<li>0 sage, due worship must be performed in front of the book in the manner of the worship of Siva. </li>' +
'<li>A fine new cloth to cover the book and a strong silken cord to tie it up must be given. </li>' +
'<li>Those who give silken cord and new cloth for the book of Purana become yogins endowed with knowledge in every birth they take. </li>' +
'<li>Many kinds of valuable objects, cloth, ornaments, vessels and much wealth in particular should be given to the discourser. </li>' +
'<li>Those who give carpets, deer skins, cloth, elevated couches and planks to keep the volume of Purana on, attain heaven, enjoy all desirable pleasures, stay in Brahma\'s region for the duration of a Kalpa and finally attain Siva\'s region.</li>' +
'<li>After performing the worship of the book as stipulated, 0 foremost among sages, and also that of the discourser with great eclat, the scholar who had been appointed assistant should be duly honoured in the same manner but with a smaller sum of money. </li>' +
'<li>Food and monetary gifts and other things must be given to the brahmin visitors. A great festival must be celebrated with vocal and instrumental music and.performance of dances. ., </li>' +
'<li>The listener shall gradually become detached and especially on the next day, 0 sage, the ·holy Gita narrated by Siva to Ramacandra must be read. </li>' +
'<li>If the listener is a householder he must perform Homa with pure Havis (holy ghee) for tranquilising the rite. </li>' +
'<li>The Homa must be performed with Rudrasamhita or with each verse of Gayatri, for in fact, this Purana is identical with it, </li>' +
'<li>or with the Miilamantra of Siva of five syllables. If he is incompetent to perform Homa let him give the gheeo:ffering to a brahmin. </li>' +
'<li>In order to suppress the defects of deficiency and excess he shall either read or listen with devotion to the thousand names of Siva. </li>' +
'<li>Undoubtedly, thus, every thing shall be fruitful and the fruit too shall be excellent since there is no greater thing in the· three worlds than this. ·</li>' +
'<li>He shall feed eleven brahmins with honey and milk puddings. He must give them Dakshina also to complete the rite. </li>' +
'<li>If he is competent, 0 sage, he must make an image of a lion with three Palas of gold and either engrave the name of this Puranaa on it or affix a label with the name written on it. He must worship his preceptor of great restraint with the gifts of cloth, ornaments, scents etc., and hand them over to him for propitiating Siva. </li>' +
'<li>0 Saunaka, by the power of this gift and of the PuraJ).a he shall secure the blessings of Siva and be freed from the bondage of worldly existence. </li>' +

'<li>Thus I have narrated to you the greatness of Sivapurana that bestows every cherished desire. What else do you wish to hear ? </li>' +
'<li>The Sivapurana holds the mark of distinction among all Puranas. It is highly pleasing to Siva. It wards off the ailment of worldly existence. </li>' +
'<li>Those who are always engaged in the meditation of Siva, those whose tongue adores the attributes of Siva, and those whose ears listen to the story of Siva, cross the ocean of worldly existence. </li>' +
'<li>I seek refuge in Siva the great, of infinite thickset bliss, Siva whose form is unaffected by all the three Gunas, Siva who manifests Himself within and without this world, within and without the mind, Siva whose form is variously evolved by mental ideas and verbal expressions. </li></ol>' + '<br/><a href=\'#top\'><strong>Back To Top</strong></a></p>',

'<li>Now, 0 Suta of good mentality, we have only one point to be clarified. If thou dost desire to bless us, please explain the same, though it be the secret of secrets. </li>' +
'<li>At the advent of the terrible age of Kali men have become devoid of merits. They are engaged in evil ways of life. They have turned their faces from truthful avocations. </li>' +
'<li>They are engaged in caluminating others. They covet other men\'s wealth. Their attention is diverted to other men\'s wives. Injuring others has become their chief aim. </li>' +
'<li>They view the physical body as the soul, deluded as they are; they are atheists of mere brutish sense; they hate their parents; their wives are goddesses unto them; they are slaves to lust. </li>' +
'<li>Brahmins are in the clutches of greed, they sell Vedas for livelihood ; they acquire learning as a means of earning money; they are deluded by their false pride. </li>' +
'<li>They have forsaken the duties of their own castes; they have almost become swindlers of others; they do not offer Sandhya prayers thrice a day; they are deprived of Vedic enlightenment. </li>' +
'<li>They are ruthless; they make much of their little knowledge; they have discarded many of their rites and good conduct of life; they have taken to agriculture as their profession; cruelty has become second nature to them; their ideas have become dirty and defiled. </li>' +
'<li>Similarly the Kshatriyas also have discarded their duties ; they associate with evil men; they indulge in sinful activities; vice and debauchery have become their main aim in life. </li>' +
'<li>They have ceased to be valorous; they never take interest in virtuous warfare; they flee from the battlefield; they follow the mean tactics of thieves and Siidras; they are mentally enslaved by base passions. </li>' +
'<li>They have eschewed the practice of miraculous weapons; they never care to protect cows and brahmins; they no longer consider it their duty to protect those who seek refuge in them; they always indulge in brutish sexual dalliance with their damsels. </li>' +
'<li>The good virtue of protecting their subjects they have thrown over-board; they strictly adhere to sensual enjoyment ; they are wicked annihilators of their own people ; they rejoice in the harassment of all living beings. </li>' +
'<li>Vaisyas too no longer perform holy rites; they have cast off their traditional virtue; they have taken to crooked .. ways. to earn more and more; they are now notorious for their malpractices with the wei~hing balance. </li>' +
'<li>They are no longer devoted to preceptors, gods and brahmins ; their intellect has become distorted ; miserly and tight-fisted they no longer feed the brahmins. </li>' +
'<li>They take delight in being the paramours of beautiful women ; squalid and filthy in their ideas and deluded by cupidity they have lost clear thinking; they have abandoned their zeal for Purta and other holy rites such as digging wells, tanks, planting trees and parks. </li>' +
'<li>Similarly most of the Sudras have become depraved. Some of them show their interest in leading the life of brahmins with shining forms and features ; they too in the confusion of their minds have abandoned their traditional practices. </li>' +
'<li>In their eagerness to appropriate a brahmanical splendour they frequently perform penances. They cause infantile and premature deaths by their chanting of mantras. </li>' +
'<li>They worship the Salagrama stone and other things; they evince some interest in Homas too but in their thoughts and actions they are crooked and antagonistic ; they calumniate the brahmins. </li>' +
'<li>Rich people indulge in misdeeds ; learned people take perpetual delight in disputations; those who conduct discourses in holy narratives and expound virtuous rites of worship, themselves abandon virtuous practice of the same. </li>' +
'<li>Haughty persons assume the features of noble kings; those who liberally give, do so with a lot of fuss and haughtiness thinking themselves to be great lords and treating the brahmins and others as their servants. </li>' +
'<li>Devoid of the strict observance of their traditional duties and virtues, the foolish people have brought about an admixture of various castes. Cruel in thought and obsessed by false prestiges, people have discarded the four-fold system of social classification. , </li>' +
'<li>Deluded people, wrongly considering themselves high-born, perform certain good rites which result only in the upset of the caste-order and down-fall of all people. </li>' +
'<li>Women too generally misbehave and err,; they slight their husbands ; they are inimical to their fathers-inlaw ; fearlessly they pursue their nefarious activities. </li>' +

notes: ['25. Panchananam : In Hindu Mythology God Siva has five faces. Pisupata teachers had developed a special doctrine ofPaiicd-Brahma in which they ascribed five faces to Siva symbolising the five elements (Linga. 2. 14. 1. 33., SP I. 10. 1-g). It is stated that Siva has the form of twentyfive tattvas symbolised by his five faces as follows : ' +

'<p>Thus the whole scheme of creation is explained by the doctrine of Panca-Brahma. The great statue of Siva in the Elephanta caves represents the Panca-Brahma form which is also known as Mahesamurti in which the frontal view depicts three heads only, the fourth one on the back is conceale-d from view and the fifth one on the top dropped out as the symbol of invisible Akasa or Avyakta Prakrti : See V. S. Agrawal : A1atsya Puriil;za : A Study PP. 51-52. 26 </p>',
        '26 Vyasa : The title is applied to Vedavyasa, the arranger of the Vedas, the compiler of the Mahabharata, the founder of the Vedanta philosophy and the arranger of the Puranas. Dawson doubts the identity of these different arrangers. Vyasa is also called KrishnaDvaipayana. From his complexion he received the name KrsnQa and from his birth place he was called Dvaipayars regarded the confluence at Prayaga as the visible symbol of Madhyadda. ',
        '27Prayaga is a celebrated place of pilgrimage at the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna in the Naimi~a forest (Sp.VS. I. 4). It is situated on the northern bank of the Ganges (Sk. II. ii. 12. 36). The name \'Prayaga\' is recorded by Hwen Thsang in the seventh ct"ntury and is as old as the reign of Asoka who set up the stone pillar about 23!:> B. C. The Gupta emperors regarded the confluence at Prayaga as the visible symbol of Madhyadda. ',
        '28 Brahmaloka, also caJled Satyaloka, is the abode of Brahma. ',
        '29 Romaharsana or Lomaharsana was one of the five disciples (the other four being Paila, Vaisampayana, Jaimini and Sumantu) to whom Vyisa taught· the Pura~1a which he constructed out of ancient material.· Pargiter : AIHT. Ch. II. '

'<li>The entire essence of Vedanta is contained in the excellent Sivapurana. It dispells all sins. It affords the attainment of the highest truth (Brahma) hereafter. </li>' +
'<li>0 brahmins, the great glory of Siva, that destroys the sin of the Kali age, unfolds itself in the Purana and yields the fruits of the four varieties (Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mok~a). </li>' +
'<li>By the singleMminded study of that most excellent Sivapurana excellent brahmins will attain salvation. </li>' +
'<li>It is only as long as the Sivapurana has not risen high in the world, that Brahma-hatya (the sin of slaying a brahmin) and other sins display themselves. </li>' +
'<li>It is only as long as the Sivapurana has not risen high in the world, that the evil portents of Kali fearlessly roam about. </li>' +
'<li>It is only as long as the SivapuraQ.a has not risen high in the world, that the different sacred texts clash together in disputation. </li>' +
'<li>It is difficult even to great men to· comprehend Siva\'s features as long as the Sivapurana has not risen high in the world. </li>' +

'<li>All those gods engage themselves in mutual disputes as long as the Sivapurana has not risen high in the world. </li>' +
'<li>All the philosophical tenets engage themselves in mutual disputes as long as the Sivapurana has not risen high in the world. </li>' +
'<li> 0 foremost among brahmanical sages, I cannot adequately describe the fruit accruing from reciting and listening to this Sivapurana. </li>' +
'<li>Even then, 0 sinless ones, I shall succinctly describe its greatness as narrated to me by Vyasa. Please listen attentively. </li>' +
'<li>He who reads a single stanza or even half of it piously hecomes free from sin instantaneously. </li>' +
'<li>He who reads every day as much of Sivapurana as he can with devotion and alertness is called Jivanmukta (a living liberated soul). </li>' +
'<li>He. who continues to worship this Sivapurana daily derives the fruit of horse-sacrifice undoubtedly. </li>' +
'<li>He who with a craving for an ordinary position in life listens to Sivapurana even from a person other than me is freed from sin. </li>' +
'<li>He who bows near this Sivapurana derives un~ doubtedly the fruit of adoration of all the gods. </li>' +
'<li>Please listen to the meritorious benefit that accrues to the man who copies Sivapurana and gives the manuscript to the devotees of Siva. </li>' +
'<li>He will have that benefit - very difficult to attain in the world - as that of the study of Sastras (sacred lore) and of comrilenting on the Vedas. </li>' +
'<li>He who observes fast on the Caturdasi (fourteenth day in the lunar fortnight) and conducts discourses and comments on the Sivapurana in the assembly of the devotees of Siva is the most excellent of all. </li>' +
'<li>He shall derive the benefit of the repetition of Gayatri<noteref1_note1footer>(6) - (30)</note> syllable by syllable. He will enjoy all worldly pleasures here and attain salvation hereafter. </li>' +
'<li>I shall tell you the benefit derived by him who reads or listens to this after observing fast on the Caturdasi day by keeping awake in the !light. </li>' +
'<li>This is the truth, undoubtedly the truth that he will get the benefit derived by the man who makes gifts of wealth equal in weight to him~elf to brahmins with Vyasas at their head at the complete eclipse of the sun, many a time, in all holy centres, Kuruksetra<noteref2_note2footer>(7) - (31)</note> etc. </li>' +
'<li>Indra and other devas wait eagerly for the directives of the man who chants day and night the verses of the Sivapurana.</li>' +
'<li> The sacred rites performed by the man who regularly reads or listens to the Sivapurana are effective millions of times more than usual.</li>' +
'<li>He who reads the Rudrasamhita portion of Sivapurana with pure and concentrated mind becomes a purified soul within three days even though he might have killed a brahmin.</li>' +
'<li>He who reads the Rudrasarilhita three times a day near the image of Bhaira va, refraining from useless talk, shall get all cherished desires fulfilled. </li>' +
'<li>If a slayer of brahmin circumambulates the trees of Vata and Bilva reciting the verses from Rudrasamhita he will become purified of the sin of Brahmin-slaughter. </li>' +
'<li>The Kailasa samhita is even greater than that. It is of Vedic status and stature. The meaning of Pranava (the sacred syllable Om) is amplified in it. </li>' +
'<li>0 Brahmins, Lord Siva knows the greatness of Kailasasamhita in its entirety. Vyasa knows half of it and I a moiety of the same. </li>' +
'<li>A part of it, I shall tell you, since it is impossible to say everything. On comprehending it people attain purity of their minds instantaneously. </li>' +
'<li>0 Brahmins, seeking for it ever and anon, I do not see a sin that cannot be quelled by Rudrasamhita. </li>' +
'<li>Drinking that nectar prepared by Lord Siva after churning the ocean of the Upanisads (a class of Vedic literature) and handed over to Kumara (Lord Kartikeya) the devotee shall become immortal. </li>' +
'<li>The person intending to perform expiatory rites for the sins of Brahma-hatya etc. should read that Samhita for a month. He shall be freed of that sin. </li>' +
'<li>By a single recital, that Samhita destroys the sin originating from the acceptance of monetary gifts from defiled persons, partaking of defiled food and indulging in foul talks. </li>' +
'<li>The benefit derived by a person who reads that Sarhhita in the grove of Bilva trees in a temple of Siva is beyond description in words. </li>' +
'<li>If a person reads that Samhita with devotion at the time of performing Sraddha and feeding the brahmins, all his Pitrs (manes) attain the great region of Siva. </li>' +
'<li>The devotee who observes fast on the Caturdasi day and reads that Sarhhita under the Bilva tree is directly identified with Siva and is worshipped by the gods. </li>' +
'<li>The other Samhitas are no doubt the bestowers of the benefit of fulfilling all cherished desires. These two Samhitas are particularly excellent as they are full of divine sports and divine knowledge. </li>' +
'<li>Such is the Sivapurana, extolled on a par with the Vedas, created by Lord Siva Himself at first and commensurate with the supreme Brahman. </li>' +
'<li>Originally the Sivapurana was of very enormous size consisting of twelve sacred Samhitas :-(1) Vidye8vara (2) Rudra, (3) Vainayaka, ( 4) Aumika, ( 5 ) Matri (6) Rudraikadasa, (7) Kailasa, (8) Satarudraka, (9) Sahasrakotirudra, (10) Kotirudra, (11) Vayaviya and (12) Dharmasariljfia. 0 brahmins, I shall mention the number of verses in those Samhitas. Please listen with due attention.</li>' +
'<li>The first Samhhita of Vidyesvara, consisted of ten thousand verses. The Raudra, Vainayaka Aumika and Matr Sarhhitas consisted of eight thousand verses each. </li>' +
'<li>0 brahmins, the Rudraikadasa samhita consisted of thirteen thousand verses; the Kailasa samhi Hi of six thousand verses and the Satarudra of three thousand verses.</li>' +
'<li>The Kotirudra samhita consisted of nine thousand verses ; the Sahasrakoti-Rudra samhita of eleven thousand verses. </li>' +
'<li>The Vayaviya samhita consisted of 4000 verses and the Dharma samhita of twelve thousand verses. Thus the whole Sivapurana contained a hundred thousand verses. </li>' +
'<li> That has been condensed by Vyasa to twenty-four thousand verses; that is to about a fourth of the original PuraiJ.a and he retained seven samhitas. </li>' +
'<li>The Puranic lore at the. time of the first creation as conceived by Siva contained a thousand million (hundred crores) verses.</li>' +
'<li>In the Krta age<noteref3_note3footer>(8) - (32)</note>  Dvaipayana and others condensed it into four hundred thousand verses which in the beginning of Dvapara age was separated into eighteen different Puranas. </li>' +
'<li>Of these the Sivapurana contains twenty-four thousand verses with seven Samhitas and the Purana is on a par with the Vedas (in excellence). </li>' +
'<li>The .first Sarnhita is called Vidyesvara, the second Rudra, the third Satarudra and the fourth Kotirudra. </li>' +
'<li>The fifth is Aumi (of Uma), the sixth Kailasa and the seventh Vayaviya ; these are the seven Sarbhitas. </li>' +
'<li>Thus the divine Sivapurana with its seven Samhitas stands on a par with the Vedas, according salvation more than anything else. </li>' +
'<li>He who reads this Sivapurana complete with the seven Samhitas devotedly is a living liberated soul.</li>' +
'<li>Hundreds of other sacred texts as the Vedas, Smrtis, Puranas, Itihasas., and Agamas do not merit even a sixteenth of this Sivapurana. </li>' +
'<li> Sivapurana is first expounded by Siva and then condensed by Vyasa, a devotee of Siva. It is pure and brief and as such it renders help to all living beings. As a queller of the threefold calamities {physical, extraneous and divine) it is unrivalled. It bestows welfare upon the good. </li>' +
'<li>Undeceptive virtue is extolled herein; it is, in the main, of the nature of Vedantic wisdom. It contains mantras, and three aims of life and the thing knowable by wise men of unprejudiced mind. The Sivapurana is the best among the Puranas, extolling the great Being that glows in Vedanta and the Vedas. He who reads and listens to it with devotion becomes a favourite of Siva and attains the supreme position (here and thereafter)</li></ol>' + '<br/><a href=\'#top\'><strong>Back To Top</strong></a></p>',

'<li>May ye all hear the Purana that embibes the essence of the Vedas. Formerly, when many Kalpas (Aeons) elapsed and this Kalpa started with the process of creation, a· great dispute arose among the sages of six clans who held divergent views as to which is great and which is not. They approached Brahma the Creator, to ask him about the imperishable. </li>' +

        '"That from whom words recede, not approaching , him even with the mind ; that from whom this entire universe beginning with Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra and Indra, along with all elements and all sense-organs, is evolved at first ; he is the lord Mahadeva the omniscient, the lord of the universe. He can be realised by supreme devotion and not by other means. "</p>' +
'<li>Rudra, Hari, Hara and other lords of Devas are ever desirous of seeing Him, moved by great devotion. </li>' +
'<li>Of what avail is a verbose statement ? One is liberated by devotion unto Siva. Devotion to the deity is due to His Grace; and His grace is due to devotion just as the seed gives rise to the sprout and the sprout produces the seed. </li>' +

'<li>The attainment of Siva\'s region is the Achievable. Means of achievement is the service rendered unto Him. Sadhaka (the performer of the rite) is the person who is free from desire even for permanence which attitude is the result of His grace. </li>' +
'<li>Rites mentioned in the Vedas should be performed with the fruits thereof dedicated to Him. Thence, through Salokya<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (33)</note> he attains the feet of the great Lord. </li>' +
'<li>All attain the great fruit according to the standard in devotion achieved. The ways of achieving these standards are manifold as expounded by lsa Himself. </li>' +
'<li>I shall condense the same and tell you the essential means. Listening to the glory of Siva, glorifying him by me~ns of words, and deliberation in the mind, these constitute the greatest of the means. Mahesvara is to be heard, glorified and meditated upon. </li>' +
'<li>Thus Sruti<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (34)</note> is our authority. Resorting solely to this great means, all of you attain the Achievable. </li>' +
'<li>Regarding visible things people see with their eyes and begin their act1v1ty. Concerning. the invisible everywhere, they know through the ears and activise themselves. </li>' +
'<li>Hence Sravana (listening) is the :first rite. The intelligent scholar must listen to the oral explanation of the preceptor and then practise the other rites.-Kirtana (glorifying) and Manana {deliberation).</li>' +
'<li>When all the means upto Manana are well exercised, Sivayoga (unification with Siva) results gradually through Salokya etc. All the ailments of the body are nullified and supreme bliss is realised.

'<li>A person incompetent to perform the three rites of Sravana etc. shall fix the phallic emblem or the image of Siva and worship them every day. He can thus cross the ocean of worldly existence. </li>' +
'<li>As far as he can afford, the devotee shall make gifts of wealth too without deceiving others. He shall offer them to the phallic emblem or the image of Siva. He must worship them constantly. </li>' +
'<li>The worship must be performed elaborately. Construction of platforms, ornamental portals, monasteries, temples, holy centres, etc., offerings of cloth, scents, garlands, incense, lamps, with due piety; oblations of various cooked rice, pancakes, pies etc. with side dishes ; umbrellas, fans, chowries with all paraphernalia-everything shall be maintained in the worship of Siva. In fact, all royal homage shall be paid. Circumambulation and obeisance with Japas according to capacity shall be performed. All the different usual rites in worships like invocation shall be maintained with due devotion.

'<li>Everywhere the deities are worshipped only in their image. How is it that Siva is worshipped both in the. image and the phallus? </li>' +
'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:green;font-size:larger"> Suta said:  </span> ' +
'<li>0 sages, this question is holy and wondrous. Here the speaker is Siva Himself and not any ordinary person. </li>' +
'<li>I shall tell you what Siva Himself had said and what I heard from my own preceptor. Siva alone is glorified as Niskala (nameless and formless) since He is identical with supreme Brahman. </li>' +
'<li>He is also Sakala as He has an embodied form. He is both Sakala and Niskala. It is in his Niskala aspect that the Linga<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (37)</note> is appropriate.</li>' +
'<li>In the Sakala aspect the worship of his embodied form is appropriate. Since He has the Sakala and Niskala aspects He is worshipped both in the phallic and in the embodied form by the people and is called the highest Brahman. Other deities, not being Brahman, have no Niskala aspect anywhere. </li>' +
'<li>Hence the deities are not worshipped in the formless phallic symbol. The other deities are both nonBrahman and individual souls. </li>' +
'<li>In view of their being embodied alone they are worshipped solely in the bodily form. Sankara has Brahmatva and the others Jivatva. </li>' +
'<li>This has been explained · in the meaning of the Pranava (Om), the essence of Vedanta, by Nandikesvara<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (38)</note> when asked by Sanatkumara, the intelligent son of Brahma, at the mountain Mandara.</li>'  +
'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:darkblue;font-size:larger"> Sanatkumara said:  </span> ' +
'<li>The embodied form alone is often observed in the worship of the deities other than Siva. But both the phallic and the embodied forms are seen only in the worship of Siva. Hence 0 benevolent one, please tell me precisely making me understand the truth.</li>' +
'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:darkgreen;font-size:larger"> Nandikeswara said:  </span> ' +
'<li>It is impossible to answer this question without revealing the secret of Brahman. </li>' +
'<li>0 sinless one, since you are pious I shall tell you what Siva Himself has said . Since Siva has the bodiless aspect in virtue of His being the supreme Brahman, the Niskala linga, in conformity with the Vedic implication, is used only in His worship. Since He has an embodied form as well, His embodied form is also worshipped and accepted by all people. According to the decision in the Vedas, the embodied form alone is to be used in the worship of other deities who are only individual souls embodied. Devas have only the embodied aspect in their manifestation. In sacred literature both the phallic and the embodied forms are mentioned for Siva. </li>' +
'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:darkblue;font-size:larger"> Sanatkumara said:  </span> ' +
'<li>0 Fortunate one, you have explained the worship of phallus and image distinctly for Siva and the other deities. Hence, 0 lord of Yogins, I wish to hear the feature of the manifestation of the phallic aspect of Siva.</li>' +
'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:darkgreen;font-size:larger"> Nandikeswara said:  </span> ' +
'<li>0 dear one, out of love for you I shall tell you the truth. Long long ago, in the famous first Kalpa<noteref3_note3footer>(3) - (39)</note> the noble souls Brahma and Visnu fought each other. </li>' +
'<li>In order to eradicate their arrogance lord Paramesvara showed his unembodied Niskala form in the form of a column in their. midst. </li>' +
'<li>He showed his phallus emblem separate, evolved out -of the column, with a desire to bless the worlds. </li>'+
'<li>From that time onwards the divine phallus and the embodied image, both, were assigned to Siva alone. </li>' +
'<li>The embodied form alone was assigned to deities other than Siva. The different types of the embodied forms of the different Devas yield only enjoyments.

'39.  The term Kalpa in a precise sense means a vast cosmic period but this seems to have been a later application of it, when the scheme of cosmological time was developed. It is often used in a simpler and unspecialized way to mean \'a period of time\', \'an age.\' This seems to have been its earlier signification, as where it is said \'PuraKalpa -mahakale\' in old time, long, long ago. In such texts Purakalpa js often used loosely ~nd has the generall sense of \'Old time\'. ']

'<li>Thus the consort of Amba consoled the concourse of devas with honeylike speech sweetened with a smile in the manner of appeasing children. </li>'+
'<li>In that very assembly the Lord announced his desire to go to the battlefield of Hari and Brahma and accordingly issued His directive to a hundred of the commanders of his attendants .. </li>'+
'<li>Different kinds of musical instruments were played to announce the start of the journey of the Lord. The commanders of the attendants were in readiness fully bedecked in their ornaments, seated in their respective vehicles. The lord, consort of Ambika, mounted the holy chariot shaped like Omkara from front to the back and embellished 1n five circular rings. He was accompanjed by his sons and Ganas. All the Devas, Indra and others, followed. </li>'+
'<li>Honoured suitably by the display of banners of various colours, fans, chowries, scattered flowers, music, dance and the instrument players, and accompanied by the great goddess (Parvati ), Pasupati (Siva) went to the battle-field with the whole army. </li>'+
'<li>On espying the battle, the lord vanished in the firmament. The play of the music stopped and the tumult of the Ganas subsided. </li>'+
'<li>There in the battlefield Brahma and Acyuta desirous of killing each other were awaiting the result of the Mahesvara and the Pasupata weapons hurled by them. </li>'+
'<li>The flames emitted by the two weapons of Brahma and Visnu burned the three worlds. On seeing this imminent untimely dissolution, the bodiless form of Siva assumed the terrific form of a huge column of fire in their midst. </li>'+
'<li>The two weapons of fiery flame potential enough to destroy the entire world fell into the huge column of fire that manifested itself there instantaneously. </li>'+
'<li>Seeing that auspicious wonderful phenomenon assuaging the weapons they asked each other "What is this wonderful form ?" </li>'+
'<li>"What is this column of fire that .has risen up ? It is beyond the range of senses. We have to find out its top and bottom." </li>'+
'<li>Jointly deciding like this, the two heroes proud of their prowess immediately set about assiduously in their quest. </li>'+
'<li>"Nothing will turn up if we are together". Saying this, Vigm assumed the form of a Boar and went in search of the root. Brahma in the form of a swan went up in search of the top. Piercing through the netherworlds and going very far below, Visnu could not see the root of the fiery column. Utterly exhausted, Vigm in the form of a Boar returned to the former battle-ground. </li>'+
'<li>Dear one, your father, Brahma who went high up in the sky saw a certain bunch of Ketaki flower of mysterious nature falling from above. </li>'+
'<li>On seeing the mutual fight of Brahma and Visnu, lord Siva laughed. When his head shook, the Ketaki flower dropped down. Although it had been in its downward course for many years, neither its fragrance nor its lustre had been diminished even a bit. The flower had been intended to bless them. </li>'+

'<li> "Dear friend, hereafter you must do as I desire. In the presence of Visnu you must say like this. 0 Acyuta, the top of the column has been seen by Brahma. I am the witness for the same." Saying this he bowed to the Ketaki flower again and again. Even falsehood is recommended in times of danger. So say the authoritative texts. 26. (Returning to the original place) on seeing Visnu there, utterly exhausted and lacking pleasure, Brahm.a danced with joy. Visnu, in the manner of a eunuch admitting his inability ( to a woman), told him the truth (that he could not see the bottom). But Brahma told Vig:m like this. </li>'+
'<li>"0 Hari, the top of this column has been seen by me. This Ketaki flower is my witness." The Ketaka flower repeated the falsehood endorsing the words of Brahma in his presence. Hari, taking it to be true, made obeisance to Brahma. He worshipped Brahma with all the sixteen means of service and homage.<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (42)</note>--> </li>'+
'<li>The Lord taking up a visible form in order to chastise Brahma who practised trickery, came out of the column of fire. 0 n seeing the lord, Visnu stood up and with his hands shaking with fear caught hold of the lord\'s feet. </li>'+
'<li>It is out of ignorance and delusion about you whose body is without a beginning or an end that we indulged in this quest prompted by our own desire. Hence 0, Sympathetic Being, forgive us for our fault. In fact, it is but another form of your divine sport. </li>'+

'<li>By the worship on Sivaratri day the devotee attains that fruit which usually accrues tp one who continuously worships me for a year. </li>'+
'<li>This is the time when the virtue of devotion to me increases like the tide in the ocean at the rise of the moon. Festivities like the installation of my idols etc. on that day are very auspicious. </li>'+

'<li>He who sees me on the day of Ardra star in the month of Margasiqa in the company of Uma and worships my phallic emblem or embodied image is dearer to me than even Guha (Kartikeya) .</li>'+

'<li>Dear sons, first in the form of the column and afterwards in this embodied form I have expounded to you ·my formless Brahma-hood, and embodied !Sa-hood. These two are present only in me and not in anyone else. Hence no one else, not even you too can claim ISatva (Isa-hood). </li>'+
'<li>It is out of your ignorance of this fact that you were swept. away by your false prestige and pride of being Isa, surprising as it is. I rose up in the middle of the battle-field for quelling the same. . </li>'+
'<li>Cast off your false pride. Fix your thought in me as your lord. It is out of my favour that all the objects in the world are illuminated. </li>'+
'<li>The statement of the preceptor is the reminder and the authority on all occasions. This secret truth of Brahman I am revealing to you out of love. </li>'+
'<li>I am the supreme Brahman. My form is both manifest and unmanifest in view of my Brahma-hood and Isvaratva. My duty is blessing etc. </li>'+
'<li>0 Brahma and Visnu, I am Brahman because of Brhatva (huge size) and Bpithanatva (causing to grow). 0 children, similarly I am Atman due to Samatva (equality) and Vyapakatva (Pervasiveness). </li>'+
'<li>All others are Anatmans, individual souls undoubtedly. There are five activities <noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (45)</note> in respect of the universe beginning with Anugraha <noteref3_note1footer>(3) - (46)</note> (liberation) and ending with Sarga (creation). Therefore these activities devolve on me because I am Isa and not on anyone else. It is to make my Brahmatva understood that my phallic emblem rose up. </li>'+
'<li>In order to clarify my Is a tva, unknown hitherto, I have manifested myself immediately in the embodied form of ISa. </li>'+
'<li>The Isatva in me is to be known as the embodied form and this symbolic column is indicative of my Brahmatva. </li>'+
'<li>Since it has all the characteristic features of my phallic emblem, it shall be my symbol. 0 sons, you shall worship it every day . </li>'+
'<li>The phallic symbol and the symbolised Siva are non-different. Hence this phallic emblem is identical with me. It brings devotees quite near to me. It is worthy of worship therefore. </li>'+
'<li>0 dear sons, if phallic emblem of this sort in installed I can be considered installed, though my idol is not installed. </li>'+
'<li>The result of installing the phallic emblem is the attainment of similarity with me. If a second phallic emblem is installed, the result is union with me. </li>'+
'<li> The installation of the phallic emblem is primary and that of embodied idol is secondary. A temple with the embodied idol of Siva is unfructuous if it has no phallic image. </li>'+

'<li>I shall tell you the great secret of the five-fold duties, out of compassion for you. </li>'+
'<li>0 Brahma and Visnu, the permanent cycle of the five-fold duties consists of creation, maintenance, annihilation, concealment, and blessing. </li>'+
'<li>Sarga is the creation of the world ; Sthiti is its maintenance; Samhara is the annihilation; Tirobhava is the removal and concealment </li>'+
'<li>Liberation (from the cycle of birth and death) IS blessing. These five are my activities but are carried on by others silently as in the case of the statue at the Portal. </li>'+
'<li>The first four activities concern the evolution of the world and the fifth one is the cause of salvation. All these constitute my prerogatives. </li>'+
'<li>These activities are observed in the five elements by devotees-Sarga (creation) in the Earth, Sthiti (maintenance) in the waters, Samhara (annihilation) in the fire, Tirobhava (concealment) in the wind and Anugraha (liberation, the blessed state) in the firmament. Everything is created by the Earth; everything flourishes by virtue of the waters; everything is urged by the fire, everything is removed by the wind and everything is blessed by the firmament. Thus intelligent men must know the same. </li>'+
'<li>In order to look after these five-fold activities I have five faces, four in the four quarters and the fifth in the middle. </li>'+
'<li>0 sons, in view of your austerities you two have received the first two activities :-creation and maintenance. Yon have gratified me and are blessed therefore. </li>'+
'<li>Similarly, the other two activities (annihilation and concealment} have been assigned to Rudra and Mahesa. The fifth one of Anugraha (liberation) cannot be taken up by any other. </li>'+
'<li>All this previous arrangement has been forgotten by both of you due to lapse of time, not so by Rudra and Mahesa. </li>'+
'<li>I have assigned them my equality in form, dress, activity, vehicle, seat, weapons etc. </li>'+
'<li>0 dear sons, your delusion was the result of your not meditating upon me. If you had retained my knowledge you would not have embibed this false pride of being Mahesa yourselves. </li>'+
'<li>Hence, hereafter, both of you shall start reciting the mantra Omkara to acquire knowledge of me. It shall quell your false pride as well. </li>'+
'<li>I. have taught this great auspicious mantra. Orhkara came out of my mouth. Originally it indicated me. </li>'+
'<li>It is the indicator and I am the indicated. This mantra is identical with me. The repetition of this mantra is verily my repeated remembrance. </li>'+
'<li>The syllable "A" came first from northern face; the syllable c \'U" from the western ; the syllable "M" from the southern and the Bindu (dot) from the eastern face. The Nada (mystical sound) came from the middle face. Thus the complete set cropped up in five-fold form. Then all of them united in the syllable of "Om". </li>'+
'<li>The two sets of created beings-Nama (name) and Rupa (form) are pervaded by this mantra. It indicates Siva and Sakti. </li>'+
'<li>From this also is born the five-syllabled mantra (Namassivaya ). It indicates all knowledge. The syllables "NA" etc. follow the order of the syllables "A" etc. </li>'+
'<li>From the five-syllabled mantra the five mothers were born. The Siromantra is born of that. The three-footed Gayatri also came out of the four faces. </li>'+
'<li>The entire set of Vedas and crores of mantras were born of that. Different things are achieved through different mantras but everything is achieved through Ori:Jkara alone. </li>'+
'<li>By this root-mantra, the very enjoyment as well as salvation is achieved. All the royal mantras are auspicious and directly accord enjoyment. </li>'+
'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:darkgreen;font-size:larger"> Nandikeswara said:  </span> ' +
'<li>The phallic emblem confers enjoyment. It is the only means of worldly enjoyment and salvation. Viewed, touched or meditated upon, it wards off all future births of the living beings. </li>'+
'<li>The lord in the company of his. consort Ambika, assumed the role of the preceptor for both of them. He screened them and placed his lotus-like hand on their heads as they faced the north and slowly taught them the great mantra. </li>'+
'<li>The two disciples received the mantra by repeating it thrice, along with the requisite Yantra and Tantra<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (47)</note> duly expounded. By way of fees, the disciples dedicated themselves. Thereafter standing near him with hands clasped in reverence they addressed the lord, the preceptor of the universe. </li>'+

'<li>0 dear sons, the truthful extract of every-thing has been narrated to you with demonstration. You shall recite as directed by the Goddess this Om mantra which is identical with me. </li>'+
'<li>Your knowledge shall be stabilised. Permanent fortune shall stand by you. On the Chaturdasi day and on the day with Ardra star, the recital of this mantra will give you everlasting efficacy. </li>'+
'<li>The recital of this mantra at the time when the transit of the sun is in the Ardra star is million-fold efficacious. In the context of worship, Homa and Tarpana, the last quarter of the star Mrgasiras and the first quarter of Punarvasu must always be considered on a par with Ardra. The Vision is to be had at early dawn and within three muhilrtas (two hours twentyfour minutes) thereafter. </li>'+
'<li>Chaturdasi is to be taken when it continues up to midnight. If it is only upto the early part of the night and joined with another thereafter, it is also recommended. </li>'+
'<li>Although I consider the phallic and the embodied form to be equal, the phallic form is excellent for those who worship. Hence for those who seek salvation the latter is preferable to the former. </li>'+
'<li>The others too shall install the phallic form with Omkara mantra and the embodied form with the fivesyllabled mantra, with excellent articles of worship and adore with due homage. It will be easy for them to attain my region. ' +

Siva and the gods of His family shall be adored. The preceptor is given monetary gifts. Kinsmen are propitiated with whatever they desire. Money is distributed among the mendicants. All objects sentient or otherwise, and all living beings movable or immovable are duly gratified. The cavity is filled with gems. Mantras "Sadyo" etc, are recited.' +
'The auspicious supreme lord is meditated upon. The great mantra Orpkara resonant with its mystical sound is repeated. The linga is then united with the Pitha (pedestal). The two are then welded together. 18. Similarly the embodied image shall also be fixed there auspiciously. For the sake of festivals the embodied image shall be installed outside with the five-syllabled mantra. </li>'+
'<li>The embodied image shall be taken from the preceptors or it must be one that has been worshipped by saintly men. Such an adoration of the embodied image and the phallic emblem accords the region of Siva. </li>'+
'<li>The phallic emblem is of two varieties : the stationary and the mobile. Trees, hedges etc. represent the stationary. </li>'+
'<li>Worms, insects etc. represent the mobile. For the stationary one, tending and similar service is recommended. For the mobile one Tarpana (propitiation) is recommended. </li>'+
'<li>With a love for the happiness of different beings Siva Puja shall be performed-so say the wise men. The pedestal represents Siva\'s consort-Parvati and his phallic emblem represents the sentient being. </li>'+
'<li>Just Rs lord Siva remains ever in close embrace of the Goddess Parvati, so also the phallic emblem holds on to the pedestal, for ever. </li>'+

'<li>The Earth, fifty crores of yojanas in extent, abounding in mountains and forests, supports the people at the bidding of Siva. </li>'+
'<li> The lord has Himself raised up these temples and holy centres in different places for the liberation of the resident\'s of these localities. </li>'+
'<li>These temples whether self-risen or not, in view of their being accepted (as their frequent resort) by the sages and Devas are intended for the redemption of the people. </li>'+

'<li>0 brahmins, committing sins in a holy centre is of ineffable character. When a man stays in a holy centre he must not commit even the smallest sin. </li>'+
'<li>Somehow men must strive to find a residence in a holy centre. On the shores of the ocean in the confluence of hundreds of rivers there are many such holy centres and temples. </li>'+
'<li>The holy river Sarasvati is said to have sixty mouths or holy centres on its banks. Hence an intelligent man must stay on its banks. He shall attain Brahma\'s region gradually.</li>'+
'<li>The river Ganga flowing from the Himalaya mountains is very holy with its hundred mouths. There are many holy centres on its banks such as Kasi etc. Its banks are highly sacred in the month of Margasira or when Brhaspati (Jupiter) is in the zodiac \'Capricornus.

'<li>If the sin committed in a holy centre is only for livelihood, the merit will destroy that sin. Merit accords prosperity and quells physical, verbal and mental sins. 0 brahmins, the mental sin is adamantine in sticking to the sinner and it continues for many Kalpas. </li>'+
'<li>The mental sin can be wiped off only by meditation and not otherwise. The verbal sin is wiped off by Japas and the physical sin by forcefully causing the emaciation of the body. Sins committed by means of wealth can be wiped off by making charitable gifts and not otherwise, though crores of Kalpas (Aeons) may elapse. In some places the increasing sin destroys the merit. </li>'+
'<li>Both Merit and Demerit have three aspects:the seed stage, flourishing stage and the enjoyment stage. If they are in the seed stage they can be quelled by perfect knowledge. If they are in the flourishing stage they can be quelled in the manner described before. If they are in the enjoyment stage they get destroyed only by enjoying and experiencing their fruits and not otherwise though one might have performed crores of meritorious deeds. <br/>'
+ 'If the seed or the flourishing seedlings are destroyed what remains must be experienced and wiped off. If one regularly performs worship of gods, makes gifts to brahmins and performs sufficient penance, the enjoyment becomes bearable.

'<ol><li>Kindly tell us the mode of good conduct whereby the sensible man quickly attains higher worlds. Please tell us about virtue and evil that cause attainment of heaven or hell.  </li>'+
'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:green;font-size:larger"> Suta said:  </span> ' +
'<li>A brahmin endowed with strict adherence to good conduct is perfectly wise. A brahmin learned in Vedas and of good conduct is called a Vipra. A brahmin endowed with only one of these two is a mere Dvija. </li>'+
'<li>A brahmin following some of the prescribed rules of conduct and with a smatterihg of the Vedas is a Ksatriya brahmin, at best a royal servant. Very careless in following the rules of conduct the brahmin is really a Vaisya brahmin. One engaged in agriculture and trading activities is also likewise. </li>'+
'<li> A brahmin ploughing the :field himself is a Sudra brahmin. One of envious and spiteful temperament is a degraded Dvija. · </li>'+
'<li>A Ksatriya  who rules over a kingdom is a "King"; others are mere Ksatriyas. A merchant dealing in grains etc. is a Vaisya and others of his caste are mere "Vaniks" </li>'+
'<li>A person rendering service to Brahmins, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas is called a Siidra. A working agriculturist is a Vnala and the others are Dasyus. </li>'+
'<li>1t  is the duty of everyone of the four castes to get up early in the morning and sit facing the east and meditate on gods. He shall then think about the various acts of virtue, of matters regarding monetary dealings, the problems connected with them, the sources of income and the items of expenditure. </li>'+
'<li>The direction in which one casts one\'s first glance on waking up indicates the good or bad that is likely to attend one on that day-the eight effects in order are-longevity, hatred, death, sin, fortune, sickness, nourishment and strength. </li>'+
'<li>The last yama ( 3 hours) of the night is called Usa and the latter half of it is sandhi (period of conjunction). A brahmin shall get up at that hour and answer the calls of nature. </li>'+
'<li>It must be in a place far off from the house. It must be a covered place. He shall sit facing the north. If it is not possible due to any obstacle he can sit facing other directions. </li>'+
'<li>He must never sit in front of water, fire, a brahmin or the idol of any god. He must screen the penis with the left hand and the mouth with the right. </li>'+
'<li>After evacuating the bowels, the faeces should not be looked at. Water drawn out in a vessel should be used for cleaning (i.e. no one should sit inside the tank or riverwater for cleaning purpose).</li>'+
'<li>Any way no one shall enter the holy tanks and rivers dedicated to deities, manes etc. and frequented by the sages. The rectum must be cleaned with mud seven, five or three times. </li>'+
'<li>The penis must be cleaned with mud as large as a cucumber fruit and the quantity of mud for the purification of the rectum shall be Prasrti (half a handful) . After the purification of the excretory organs, hands and feet must be washed and gargling shall be done for eight times. </li>'+
'<li>For gargling, the water can be taken in any vessel or a wooden cup; but water shall be spit outside (not in the river or tank). Washing of the teeth with any leaf or twig must be without using the index ~nger and outside the water. </li>'+
'<li>After making obeisance to the gods of water, the twice-born shall perform the ablution with mantras. Sick or weak persons shall take bath upto the neck or hips.</li>'+
'<li>Sprinkling water upto the knees he shall perform the Mantrasnana. He shall propitiate deities etc. sensibly with the water from the holy tank or river. </li>'+
'<li>A washed dry cloth should be taken and worn in the form of paficakaccha (wearing of the lower garment in a special way). In all sacred rites the upper cloth should also be used. </li>'+
'<li>While taking bath in the holy river or tank, the cloth worn shall not be rinsed or beaten. The sensible man shall take it to a separate tank or well or to the house itself and beat it on a rock or on a plank to the gratification of the manes, 0 brahmins. </li>'+
'<li>The Tripundraka(70.Three lines horizontally drawn over the forehead with the ash slightly pasted with water ) shall be drawn on the forehead with the Jabalaka mantra. If anyone enters water otherwise, he will surely go to hell. According to scholarly authorities the mantrasnana is as follows : Repeating the mantra "Apohistha"(71) etc. water shall be sprinkled over the head for suppressing sins. Repeating the mantra "Yasya Ksayay.a"(72) etc. water shall be sprinkled over the joints in the legs. The order is as follows :-feet, head, chest; head, chest, feet and chest, feet, head for sprinkling with water thrice. </li>'+
'<li>It is enough if one performs mantra snana when one is slightly indisposed, or when there is danger from the king or when there is civil commotion, or when there is no other way or when one is about to undertake a journey. </li>'+
'<li>He shall drink by way of Achamana reciting the mantras from Siiryanuvaka in the morning or from AgniAnuvaka in the evening and perform the ceremonial sprinkling in the middle. </li>'+
'<li>0 brahmins, at the end of the Japa of Gayatri mantra<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (73)</note> Arghya shall be offered thrice to the sun towards east and once also thereafter.</li>'+
'<li>The offering of Arghya in the morning is by lifting both the hands high up; that in the midday by letting off the water through the fingers and that in the evening by letting the water over the ground facing the west. </li>'+
'<li>In the midday the sun is to be viewed through the fingers reciting the mantra prescribed for that. The circumambulation of oneself is performed (in the prescribed manner) and the pure Achamana (without mantras) is performed. </li>'+
'<li>Sandhya prayer performed before the prescribed time is ineffective. l-Ienee Sandhya shall be performed at the prescribed time. The expiatory rite for the omission of Sandhya prayer for a day is the repetition of Gayatri a hundred times more than the usual nummer of times for ten days. If the omission is for ten days or more, Gayatri must be repeated for a hundred thousand times as atonement. </li>'+
'<li>If one omits Sandhya for a month one has to be re-invested with the sacred thread.<noteref2_note1footer>(2) - (74)</note> For the sake of prosperity deities shall be propitiated such as Isa, Gauri, Guha.<noteref3_note1footer>(3) - (75)</note>Visnu Brahma, Chandra (the. moon) and Yama. Thereafter the entire rite shall be dedicated to the supreme Brahman and pure Acamana shall be performed</li>' +
'<li>Towards the right of the holy water, in a splendid prayer hall, temple or a common Matha, or in a stipulated place in one\'s own house, one shall sit firmly with the mind in concentration and perform the Gayatri Japa after due obeisance to all gods. He shall not omit the practice of the Pranava mantra. </li>'+
'<li>While practising the Pranava he shall realise fully the identity of Jiva (the individual soul) with the supreme Brahman. The full implication of the Gayatri must be borne in the mind when the Japa is performed. "We pray to Brahma, the creator of the three worlds, to Acyuta the sustainer and Rudra the Annihilator. We meditate on the Self-luminary that prompts us in the activities of virtue and wisdom bestowing enjoyment and salvation, the Self-luminary that is the driving force behind the sense-organs, mind, intellect and acts. ofvolition." The devotee who dwells thus on the meaning constantly attains the Brahman. </li>'+
'<li>Or if incompetent to dwell on the meaning let him at least continue the recitation of the mere mantra to keep his Brahminhood in tact. An excellent brahmin must repeat the mantra a thousand times in the morning every day. </li>'+
'<li>Others shall repeat as many times as they can. In the midday Gayatri shall be repeated a hundred times; in the evening at least twenty times along with Sikha~taka [A set of eight as the tuft i.e. eight times more than stipulated.] </li>'+
'<li>He shall meditate on Vidyesa, Brahma, Visnu, ISa; Jivatman and Paramdvara stationed in the twelve esoteric centre of the body from Miiladhara (basic support) to the Brahmarandhra (the mystical aperture at the crown of the headJ, as identical with Brahman with the conception of Soham (I am He) and continue the Japa. He shall then meditate on them as stationed outside the body as well. </li>' +
'<li>From Mahat tattva (the cosmic principle) there are a thousand extraneous bodies each of which is to be passed by each mantra slowly and the Jiva must be unified with the Supreme. This is the principle on which the Japa is based. This Japa for the sake of the extraneous bodies is for two thousand times with the Sikha~taka. </li>'+
'<li>This is the tradition regarding the Japas. Repetition for a thousand times accords Brahmahood and that for a hundred times accords the region of Indra. </li>'+
'<li>Repetition for less number of times may guard the soul to a certain extent and bring about rebirth in the family of a brahmin. After the worship of the sun, the brahmin shall practise thus every day. </li>'+
'<li>A brahmin who has completed one million two hundred thousand repetitions becomes a full-fledged brahmin. A brahmin who has not completed at least a hundred thousand repetitions of Gayatri is not authorised in Vedic rites. </li>'+
'<li>Till he completes his seventieth year he shall follow these rules. Afterwards he can take to renunciation. After renunciation he shall repeat the Pranava twelve thousand times in the morning every day. </li>'+
'<li>Omissions and deficiencies of one day must be made good the next day. If the omission is continued for a month, the atonement is repetition for one hundred and fifty thousand times. </li>'+
'<li>If the omission extends beyond this, he shall take the order· of Sanyasa afresh. Then only can the defect be .fully effaced. Otherwise he is sure to fall into Raurava, the terrible hell. </li>'+
'<li>Only the person who has a cherished desire shall endeavour for virtue and wealth and not others. A brahmin shall seek salvation and practise the ways of realising Brahman for ever. </li>'+
'<li>From virtue wealth is derived and from wealth enjoyment. Vairagya (non-attachment) is the outcome of enjoyment. That is to say, when one fully enjoys the pleasures by means of wealth acquired by virtuous means one comes to the stage of Vairagya (Detached State). </li>' +
'<li>If the enjoyment is through the wealth acquired by other means, the result is the increase of passion alone. Dharma is twofold : one through the sacrificial offering and the other through the body by performing ceremonial  ablutions in a sacred river etc. One can earn wealth through virtue and divine form through penance. </li>'+
'<li>A person freed from desire gains purity and by purity he acquires knowledge. There is no doubt about it. In the ages of Krta, Treta and Dvapara penance was recommended for attaining Dharma; but in the age of Kali it is the sacrificial offering that secures Dharma for us. </li>'+
'<li>In the Krta age knowledge was acquired through meditation; in the Treta through penance; in the Dvapara through sacrifice and now in the Kali age it is through the worship of idols. </li>'+
'<li>The fruit is in accordance with the nature of merit and sin. Deficiency, increase, decrease etc are due to the difference in the articles employed and the part of the body and items of rites. </li>'+
'<li>Evil is of violent character and virtue is of pleasant nature. A person becomes miserable due to evil and secures happiness on account of virtue. </li>'+
'<li>It must be known that bad conduct leads to misery and good conduct to happiness. Hence it is the duty of everyone to acquire virtue for the sake of worldly enjoyment as well as salvation. </li>'+
'<li>If any one regularly offers sufficient material means to a brahmin with four members in his family, for a hundred years he will remain in Brahmaloka. </li>'+
'<li>The rite of Chandrayana performed a thousand times yields Brahmaloka. It is the duty of a Ksatriya to establish and sustain a thousand families. </li>'+
'<li>It yields Indraloka to him. If he maintains ten thousand families he attains Brahmaloka. According to scholars in the Vedas, a man attains the region of that deity in meditation of whom he makes charitable gifts. A man devoid of wealth shall endeavour to accumulate penance and austerities. Everlasting happiness is achieved by pilgrimages to holy centres and penances. Now I shall expound the mode of acquiring wealth through pure and lawful means. </li>' +
'<li>A brahmin shall earn wealth without cringing or exerting himself too much. He can accept monetary gifts and fees for presiding over sacrifices duly performed. </li>'+
'<li>A Ksatriya shall earn wealth by valorous exploits and a Vaisya by means of agriculture and cattle-breading~ The charitable gifts of wealth acquired by lawful means alone, are attended with good results. </li>'+
'<li>Salvation is achieved by the acquisition of Perfect knowledge by every one with the blessings of the preceptor. Salvation is realisation of one\'s own real form and the perfect bliss. </li>'+
'<li>0 brahmins, men realise all these things only if they cultivate the association of good people. A householder shall make charitable gifts of everything like money, grain etc.</li>'+
'<li>A person who desires permanent welfare for himself shall give to Brahmins fruit, grain or other articles especially when the need for the same arises. </li>'+
'<li>Water shall always be given to the thirsty. Food shall be given to the hungry and the sick. Gift of food is of four types-field, unhusked grain (or seed), uncooked food and cooked food.</li>'+
'<li>A giver of food receives half the merit of the receiver which he accumulates till the time that food is digested or as long as the glory of lord Siva reaches his ears. </li>'+
'<li>The receiver of a gift must expiate for his sin by means of austerities or by making gifts to others. Otherwise he will fall into the Raurava hell.</li>'+
'<li>Everyone shall set apart a third of his wealth for Dharma, another third for Vrddhi (flourishing) and the rest for his Bhoga (enjoyment). With the part intended for Dharma he shall perform the three rites of virtue viz. Nitya (daily prayers etc.), Naimittika (casual acts of piety) and Kamya (specific rites for the fulfilment of desires). By means of the second part he shall increase his wealth. By utilising the third part he shall e:qjoy with restraint in pure and wholesome ways. </li>'+
'<li>One tenth of the wealth acquired by agricultural operations must first be given in charity (before making the three-fold divisions) in order to wipe off the sin. He can utilise the rest as mentioned before. Otherwise he shall fall into Raurava. </li>' +
'<li>Or he is sure to be evil-minded hastening towards his own certain ruin. Sensible persons acquiring much wealth by way of usury or trading activities must likewise give away a sixth of that wealth in charity (before making the threefold divisions). </li>'+
'<li>Excellent brahmins, accepting monetary gifts from decent people, shall give away a fourth of that wealth in charity. They shall likewise give away half in charity in case of an unexpected windfall. </li>'+
'<li>If a brahmin accepts a monetary gift from an indecent fellow he shall give away the entire amount in charity. A defiled gift shall be thrown into the sea. It is more creditable if one invites persons and makes gifts to them. One\'s own enjoyment gains by it. </li>'+
'<li>A man must give others what they beg of him according to his ability. If a thing requested for is not given he will be indebted to that extent even in his next birth. </li>'+
'<li>A sensible person shall not proclaim others\' faults. 0 brahmin, whatever is seen or heard should not be spitefully repeated. </li>'+
'<li>An intelligent man shall not speak words wounding the hearts of others. For achieving prosperity he shall perform sacred rites in the fire at dawn and at dusk.</li>'+
'<li>Persons unable to perform the same, both the times, shall do so once, worshipping the sun and the fire duly. Raw rice, other food grains, ghee, fruits, bulbous roots, cooked food soaked in ghee for sacrificial rites-all these things shall be duly used as prescribed in the sacred texts. Sthalipaka ( offerings of cooked food in the vessel itself) shall be performed at the stipulated time in the manner laid down. If there is no Havya (cooked rice offering) the main sacrifice alone shall be performed. 83. Thus the daily rites have been narrated. These shall be performed always; or repeated muttering of mantra alone or the worship of the sun shall be performed. </li>'+
'<li>Those who seek welfare of the soul shall do like this. A person who seeks wealth also shall do likewise. All persons devoted to Brahmayajfia, worship of gods, worship of fire, reverence to preceptors and gratification of brahmins deserve to attain heaven. </li></ol>' + '<br/><a href=\'#top\'><strong>Back To Top</strong></a></p>',
notes: ['73· Three-footed sacred mantra of the Rgveda well-known after its metre Glyatri. It is addressed to the sun (savitar) and is therefore called Slvitri. It rum-"Tatqaviturvarel).yar:p bhargo devasya dhimahi dhiyo yo nab pracodayat."-We meditate on that excellent light of the sun. May he illuminate our minds." ',
'74· It is one of the purificatory rites prescribed in the Dharmasutras and explained in the Grhyasiitras in which the boy is invested with the sacred thread and thus endowed with second or spiritual birth and qualified to learn the Veda by heart. A Brahmin is initiated in the eighth year, a K~atriya in the eleventh, a Vaisya in the twelfth; but the term could be delayed. ',
'75· Guha, literally the mysterious one, is Karttikeya, so called because of his mysterious birth. According to a legend he was the son of Siva produced without the intervention of a woman. Siva cost his seed into fire which was afterwards received by the Ganges : Karttikeya was the result. He is therefore called as the son of Agni and Gailga. When born he was fostered by the · six Krttikas and these offering their. six breasts to the child he became six-heaqed. ']

'<li>The offering made into the fire is called firesacrifice (Agniyajna ). In the case of persons in the Brahmacarya Arama (i.e Religious Students) it is called samidadhana ( collection of sacrificial twigs) . 0 brahmins, until the rite of Aupasana (fire sacrifice of the householder) all the persons in the first Asrama perform their Vratas and special sacrifices in the fire from sacrificial twigs. </li>'+
'<li>0 brahmins, in the case of ascetics and forestdwellers who have consigned the sacred fire to the Atman, taking a restricted quantity of wholesome food is itself the sacrificial offering. </li>'+
'<li>Householders who have started their Aupasana rite shall maintain the rite in the sacrificial fire kept in a vessel or pit always. </li>'+
'<li>The sacrificial fire shall be maintained either in the Atman or in the Arani (the sacrificial churning twig from which fire is kindled) lest the fire should be extinguished by royal or divine intercession. </li>'+
'<li>0 brahmins, the offering in the fire in the evening for the fire-god is the bestower of prosperity. The offering in the morning for the sun-god is conducive to longevity. </li>'+
'<li>This is called Agniyajna in as much as it enters the sun during the day. The different sacrifices Sthalipaka etc. for the propitiation of Indra and other gods by offerings in the fire are called Devayajna. The rites of Caula (ceremony of tonsure) etc. are performed in the ordinary fir€. </li>'+
'<li>The regular study of the Vedas is called Brahmayajna. A brahmin shall perform this constantly for the propitiation of gods. </li>'+
'<li>This is to be practised by all and hence no special rules are prescribed here. Now attend to the explanation of certain Devayajnas without fire. </li>'+
'<li>At the beginning of the first creation, the omniscient, merciful Lord Mahadeva created the different week days for the benefit of the entire world. </li>'+
'<li>Lord Mahadeva, the global physician, the omnisw cient, the panacea of all panaceas, made the first day his own day that bestows good health. </li>'+
'<li>Next he created the day of his Maya (Illusion) the bestower of prosperity. Afterwards when the birth of Kumara was attended with some mishaps he created the day for the sake of surmounting mishaps and idleness. With a desire to bless the worlds and for their nurture and protection he created the next day dedicated to Visnu, the protector of the worlds. . The next day created by the lord is for the sake of the longevity of the worlds dedicated to the creator of the three worlds, Brahma, called also Paramesthin, who is the bestower of longevity too. Hence this day too bestows longevity. </li>'+
'<li>The last two days of the week created by the lord are those of Indra and Yama. In the beginning when the lord created Punya and Papa (Virtue and Sin) for making the three worlds flourish, these deities who preside over them were assigned these two days. </li>'+
'<li>The last two days are the bestowers of worldly enjoyments and removers of premature death respectively. The lord made the sun etc. who are His own manifestations and are firmly established in the solar cycle (Jyotiscakra<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (76)</note>)  the lords of the different days. Their worship in their resw pective days accords the respective benefits viz :-health, riches, removal of sickness, nourishment, longevity. enjoyw ment of pleasures and prevention of death respectively. It is said that the respective merits of the different days are secured through the gratification of the gods. Siva is the ultimate bestower of the fruits accruing from the worship of other gods as well.  </li>'+
'<li>The worship for the propitiation of the deities is, fivefold. 1. the repeated recitation of the respective mantras 2. sacrifice 3. charitable gift 4. austerities and 5. propitiation, on the altar, idol, fire or a brahmin. The sixteen forms of service and homage shall be duly observed. </li>'+
'<li>Of the fivefold forms of worship the latter are more efficacious than the former. In the absence of the earlier ones the latter ones can be observed. In the ailments of the eyes or head or for quelling leprosy, the sun shall be worshipped and the brahmins fed for a day, a month, a year or three years.</li>'+
'<li>If the action meritorious or otherwise that has begun to fructify is sufficiently strong, the ailments old age etc. are alleviated. The repetition of the mantras of the favourite deity accords the respective benefits of the day of the week. The first day of the week dedicated to the sun has the special merit of the removal of sin, especially for brahmins. </li>'+
'<li>For the sake of riches, the intelligent devotee shalL worship Lakshmi etc. on Monday with cooked rice soaked in ghee and shall feed brahmin couples. </li>'+
'<li>For alleviating ailments the devotee shall worship Kali and others on Tuesday. He shall feed brahmins with an Adhaka (a measure) of cooked rice, the pulse, black gram and green gram. </li>'+
'<li>The scholarly devotee shall worship Visnu with curd-rice on Wednesday. Sons, friends, womenfolk etc. will always be well-nourished for ever. </li>'+
'<li>A person who seeks longevity shall worship the deities for their gratification, with sacred thread, cloth, milk and ghee on Thursday. </li>'+
'<li>On Friday, for the sake of enjoyment of worldly pleasures, the devotee shall worship devas with concentration. Brahmins should be propitiated with the cooked food consisting of six :flavours.<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (77)</note> </li>'+
'<li>Good cloth should be presented to women to gladden them. The wise devotee shall worship Rudra and others on Saturday that wards off premature death, by performing Homa with gingelly seeds. He shall make gifts to the brahmins and feed them with cooked rice and gingelly seeds. Thus worshipping the deities he shall derive the fruit of good health etc. </li>'+
'<li>In the daily or special sacrifices of the deities, ceremonial ablutions, charitable gifts, repeated muttering of mantras, sacrifices, propitiation of the brahmins, in the worship of the different devas in view of special dates or special conjunction of the planets, or in the different days of the week it is the omniscient lord of the universe who bestows health and other benefits by assuming the different forms. He bestows the same according to the time, place and the deserts of the recipient. </li>'+
'<li>The articles for worship shall be in accordance with one\'s faith or local conventions. The lord bestows health etc. in accordance with the comparative quality of the same. </li>'+
'<li>In the beginning of the period of auspiciousness, the end of the period of inauspiciousness, on birth days (according to the stars) etc. the householder shall worship the planets, Sun etc. in his own house for his good health etc. </li>'+
'<li>Hence the · worship of gods bestows all desired fruits. The worship conducted by brahmins must be along with mantras and by means of gesticulations in the case of others. </li>'+
'<li>The worship shall be carried out by men seeking good benefits in all the seven days in accordance with their capacity. </li>'+
'<li>Indigent men shall worship devas with austerities and rich men by spending money. Again and again they shall do virtuous actions with sufficient faith. </li>'+
'<li>After enjoying the pleasures in heaven they are reborn again in the world. For better enjoyment the rich shall always plant trees for shade, dig tanks etc, install deities, and carry on virtuous activities. After the lapse of some time, when the virtue becomes ripe he shall achieve perfect knowledge. 0 brahmins, he who hears this chapter, or reads it or he who facilitates the hearing of the same shall derive the fruit of Devayajna.</li></ol>' + '<br/><a href=\'#top\'><strong>Back To Top</strong></a></p>',

'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:green;font-size:larger"> Suta said:  </span><br/>The pure house accords normal benefit in the rites of Devayajfia etc. ' +
'<li>The cowshed is of ten times more benefit than that. The bank of a tank is of ten times more benefit than that and the root of Tulasi plant or of Bilva or Asvattha trees is again of ten times more benefit than that. </li>'+
'<li>Similarly a temple, the bank of a holy tank, the bank of an ordinary river, the bank of a holy river and the banks of the seven holy Gangas are each of ten times more benefit than the previous. The seven holy Gangas are Ganga, Godavari, Kaveri, Tamraparnika, Sindhu, Sarayu<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (78)</note> and Reva. The shores of the sea are of ten times more benefit than the previous. The summit of a mountain is of ten times more benefit than the shores of the sea. </li>'+
'<li>The place where the mind is quite at home is the most excellent of all places. Yajna, Dana etc. accord full benefit in the Kruta age. In the Treta age they yield threefourths of the benefit. In the age of Dvapara the benefit derived is half. In the age of Kali only one fourth of the benefit is obtained. When half of the Kali age passes on, the benefit is only three-fourths of this one-fourth. </li>'+
'<li>A holy day accords a normal benefit to a puresouled devotee. 0 Scholars, the period of transit of the sun from one Zodiac to another yields ten times more benefit than that. </li>'+
'<li>The period of equinoxes, the period of tropical transit, the period of transit to the capricornus, and the time of lunar eclipse are each of ten times more benefit than the previous one. </li>'+
'<li>The auspicious hour of complete Solar eclipse is of still more benefit, than the previous. Since the sun of cosmic form is infested with poison then, there is the likelihood of ailments spreading. </li>'+
'<li>Hence for the alleviation of the serious effects of poison, the devotee shall observe ceremonial ablutions, offer gifts and mutter prayers. That period is specially holy inasmuch as it is intended for the alleviation of the after-effects of poison. </li>'+
'<li>The birth-star, and the concluding period of holy rites are of the same efficacy as the period of Solar eclipse. The time spent in the company of noble holy men is of the efficacy of crores of solar eclipses. </li>'+
'<li>Persons of unflinching devotion to austerities and perfect knowledge, yogins and ascetics deserve holy worship since they quell others\' sins. </li>'+
'<li>A brahmin who has repeated the Gayatri mantra two million four hundred thousand times. also deserves the same and accords full benefit and wordly enjoyments. </li>'+
'<li>The word Patra (one who deserves) means one who protects the giver from downfall. </li>'+
'<li>The word Gayatri means that which saves the reciter from downfall. Only a person of purified soul can save others, just as only a rich man can donate anything to others. A man of no means cannot give anything to others in this world. </li>'+
'<li>Only he who has purified himself by means of Gayatri Japa can be called a pure brahmin. He alone deserves the position of presiding over all holy rites, Dana Japa, Homa, Puja etc. He alone can save others. Any hungry rnan or woman deserves charitable gifts of cooked food. </li>'+
'<li>An excellent brahmin must be invited on an auspicious occasion and given sufficient sums of money with piety and pleasing words. They accord all desired results. A charitable gift given to a needy person yields the utmost benefit. If it is given after entreaties it yields only half the benefit. </li>'+
'<li>Monetary gifts to servants accord only one fourth benefit. 0 excellent brahmins, charitable gifts to an indigent person, only because he is born a brahmin, accord worldly enjoyment for ten years. Gifts to a brahmin Vedic scholar accord heavenly enjoyment for ten years. </li>'+
'<li>Gifts to a brahmin who regularly repeats Gayatri mantra, accord Satyaloka for ten years. Gifts to a brahmin devotee of Visnu accord Vaikuntha Loka. </li>'+
'<li>Gifts to a brahmin devotee of Siva accord Kailasa. All kinds of gifts accord enjoyments in the different Lokas. </li>'+
'<li>A person who gives cooked food attended with the ten ancillary services, on a Sunday, attains good health for ten years even in the next birth. The ten ancillary services are-Honouring, inviting, providing oil bath, washing and serving the feet, bestowing cloth, scents etc, serving side dishes of six tastes, pancakes prepared in ghee and sweet juices, betel leaves, monetary gifts, formal farewell and following a few steps-This is called Dasanga Ann adana, </li>'+
'<li>A man who renders ten sorts of ancillary services to ten brahmins on Sunday attains good health for a hundred years. If he gives the same on Monday or any other day, he attains the benefit as stipulated for that day. The benefit of food-gifts is secured in this world itself either 1n this birth or in the next. </li>'+
'<li>If in this manner he gives food on all the seven days to ten brahmins he secures good health and all other benefits for a hundred years. </li>'+
'<li>Similarly he who gives cooked rice in this manner to hundred brahmins on Sunday secures good health in Sivaloka for a thousand years. </li>'+
'<li>If he gives the same for a thousand brahmins he secures the benefit for ten thousand years. Similarly the benefit accrued for gifts on Monday and other days can be understood by a thoughtful man. </li>'+
'<li>By giving food to a thousand brahmins whose minds have been purified by Gayatri, on Sunday, the devotee attains good health and other benefits in Satyaloka. · </li>'+
'<li>By giving food to ten thousand persons he secures ·the benefits· in Visnuloka. By giving it to a ·hundred thousand persons he derives benefits in Rudraloka. </li>'+

'<li>That which is acquired by gleaning more than one ear of corn at a time or gleaning corns one by one, by fees received from disciple<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (79)</note> is called Suddhadravya (clean wealth). This wealth yields complete benefit. </li>'+
'<li>Wealth acquired by acceptance of monetary gifts is called middlesome wealth. Wealth acquired by agricultural or trading activities is called lowliest wealth. </li>'+
'<li>Wealth acquired by Ksatriyas using their valour or Vaisyas by trading activities is called excellent. So also the wealth acquired by the Sudras by salaries for service. </li>'+

'<li>The three kinds of sins-physical etc. are warded off by milk, curd and ghee. Their nourishment can be understood by scholars. </li>'+
'<li>Gift of plots of land is conducive to stability here and hereafter, 0 brahmins. Gift of gingelly seeds is conducive to strength and to the conquest of premature death. </li>'+
'<li>Gift of gold increases the power of the gastric fire and is conducive to virility. Gift of ghee is nourishing and that of cloth is conducive to long life. </li>'+
'<li>Gift of food-grains is conducive to the increase of food production. Gift of jaggery yields sweet food. Gift of silver is conducive to the increase in the quantity of semen and that of salt is conducive to the happy admixture of the six tastes. </li>'+
'<li>The gift of pumpkin gourd is conducive to nourishment. All kinds of gifts increase everything and secure all kinds of enjoyment here and hereafter, 0 brahmins. </li>'+
'<li>Gift of a virgin is conducive to worldly enjoyment throughout life. Sensible persons shall make gifts of fruits according to the season such as the fruits of jack, mango, wood apple trees, plantains, fruits from hedges, pulses of black gram, green gram, vegetables, chillies, mustards, their plants etc. </li>'+
'<li>Sensible men shall gratify the sense-organs of hearing etc. of other people for the gratification through sound etc. It gratifies the quarters too. </li>'+
'<li>Theism is that feeling in which one fully realises that all actions are fruitful. It is necessary that Vedas and sacred texts should be learnt direct from preceptors. </li>'+
'<li>Devotion to God out of fear for kinsmen or royal punishment is of inferior sort. An indigent person bereft of all means of livelihoods shall worship verbally or by means of physical activities. </li>'+
'<li>Verbal worship means recital of mantras, hymns · and Japas. Worship of physical activities means pilgrimages, observance of fast and other rites. </li>'+
'<li>Whatever one does, whether it is great or small, whatever be the means employed,-if that is dedicated to deities it becomes conducive to enjoyment. </li>'+
'<li>The two-practice of austerities and making charitable gifts-must be carried out always. Asylum should be given according to the caste of the person concerned. It is conducive to the satisfaction of the Devas and worldly enjoyments as well. Such a devotee shall always attain noble birth and enjoyments here and hereafter. If he performs the sacred rites with dedication to God, he shall attain salvation.

'<ol><li> 0 excellent one, please explain the rules of the worship of clay idols by following which all desired results will be achieved. </li>'+
'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:green;font-size:larger"> Suta said:  </span><br/>' +
'<li>You have requested for a very good thing. It bestows all wealth always. It suppresses misery instantaneously. I shall explain it. Please listen. </li>'+
'<li>It wards off premature and foul death. Even a timely death it prevents. 0 brahmins, it bestows womenfolk, sons, wealth, grains etc. The worship of idols made of clay etc. is conducive to the attainment of all cherished desires in the world. From it the devotee derives food and other edible things, cloth etc. </li>'+
'<li>Both men and women are authorized in this. The clay should be brought from the beds of rivers, lakes or wells. </li>'+
'<li>It should be washed well and pasted with scented powder and milk. The idol should be made with the hands on a raised platform. </li>'+
'<li>All the limbs, joints etc. should be perfectly shaped with the respective weapons of the deity concerned. It should be seated on Padma Asana (the lotus pose) and worshipped respectfully. </li>'+
'<li>The five deities Ganesa, Sun, Visnu, Parvati and Siva shall be usually worshipped in their images. But a brahmin shall always worship the phallic emblem of Siva. </li>'+
'<li>In order to derive the full benefit of worship, the sixteen forms of service shall be observed. The sprinkling of water over the idol shall be performed with flowers. The pouring of water shall be performed with mantras. </li>'+
'<li>The food offering shall consist of cooked rice of Sali variety. In the worship conducted in the house, 12 hanafuls of rice ( = Kudava) shall be used. In the worship in a temple constructed by men, a prastha (a particular measure) of cooked rice shall be used. In a divine temple three Prasthas of cooked rice shall be used. In the worship of self-risen image five prasthas of cooked rice shall be used. If thus used it gives complete benefit. By using twice or thrice this quantity the benefit shall be greater. </li>'+
'<li>By performing this worship a thousand times, a brahmin shall attain Satyaloka. A vessel made of wood or iron twelve angulas in width, 24 angulas in length and sixteen angulas in height is called Siva. An eighth part of it is called a Prastha and it is equal to four Kudavas. If ten, hundred or thousand prasthas of water, oil, incense etc. are used in temples of human construction, of saintly worship or of self-risen idol, the worship is called Mahapuja. </li>'+
'<li>The ceremonial bath is conducive to the purity of the soul; the application of scented paste yields virtue. The food offering is conducive to longevity and gratification and the incense yields wealth. </li>'+
'<li>The lighting of the lamp is conducive to knowledge and the betel leaves are conducive to enjoyment. Hence in all worships these six items are scrupulously observed. </li>'+
'<li>Obeisance to the deity and repeated recitation of mantras accord all cherished desires. They must be observed at the end of the worship by men who seek both worldly enjoyment and salvation. </li>'+
'<li>At first all items shall be gone through mentally and then item by item every rite shall be performed. By the worship of deities, the devotee attains the different regions. </li>'+
'<li>In the subsidiary worlds also there is an ample scope for enjoyment. 0 brahmins, I shall narrate · the special types of worship to which please listen with faith. </li>'+
'<li>By the worship of Ganesa the devotee shall attain his wish in this world itself. The days of special worship of Ganesa are Fridays, the fourth day of the bright half of the lunar months of Sravar;ta and Bhadrapada, and the Satabhi~ak star of the month of Dhanus. He shall be worshipped duly on these days. Or the devotee shall worship continuously for hundred or thousand days. </li>'+
'<li>As a result of the faith in the deity and in the fire, the worship yields sons or the different wishes to the devotees. It quells all sins and the various hardships. </li>'+
'<li>The worship of Siva and others on their respective days of the week is conducive to the purity of soul. In regard to Kamya rites, the basis is either the Tithi or the star or the particular combinations of planetary positions. </li>'+
'<li>The day of the week is the basis for the worship of Brahman and others. There is no increase or decrease with respect to the days of the week as in regard to the Tithi, star etc. A day is calculated from sunrise to sunrise. </li>'+
'<li>The worship of the deities on the respective Tithis etc. is conducive to full enjoyment for the devotees. In regard to rites of the manes, the earlier part must be in contact with the night previous. In the worship of deities the latter part must be in conjunction with the day. If the Tithi extends to mid-day, that part of it which falls at sunrise shall be taken for the worship of the deities, so also in regard to the stars. Hence a devotee shall consider all these aspects and proceed with the worship, repeated recitation of the mantras etc. </li>'+
'<li>The word Puja is thus derived: \'Puh\' means \'the achievement of the fruits of enjoyment.\' By the rite one achieves the fruits. \'Jayate\' means "is born." Good ideas, knowledge etc. also are included in this. The word Puja is used in this sense amongst the people as well as in the sacred texts. </li>'+
'<li>The daily and occasional rites yield their benefits in due course but the fruits of Kamya rites are instantaneous. The necessary rites are performed everyday. The occasional rites are· ·performed in particular months, fortnights, years or on special occasions. In the Kamya rites one derives the fruits after the sin has been duly quelled. Mahaganapati Puja shall be performed on the Chaturthi day of the dark half of the lunar month. </li>'+
'<li>That rite wipes off the sin of the whole fortnight and yields enjoyment for full fortnight. The worship performed on the Caturthi day of the lunar month of Caitra accords benefit for a month. </li>'+
'<li>The worship performed in the months of Simha and Bhadrapada accords enjoyment of worldly pleasures for a year. The worship of the sun shall be performed on Sundays, or Saptami (seventh) day or in the star Hasta of the month of ·Sravarya or on the Saptami in the bright half of the month of Magha. The worship of Visnu is conducive to the attainment of all desires and wealth if performed on Wednesdays, Dvadasi (12th) day or in the star of Sravana in the months of Jyestha and Bhadrapada. The same worship in the month of Sravana yields all desired wishes and good health.</li>'+
'<li>Propitiation of VinU on the Dvadasi day yields the same benefit as is derived from the gift of the twelve things with ancillary rites. </li>'+
'<li>The devotee shall worship twelve brahmins on the Dvadasi day assigning them the twelve names of Visnu with all the sixteen forms of service. He shall gratify the deity thereby. </li>'+
'<li>Similarly twelve brahmins shall he worshipped after assigning them the twelve names of any deity to gratify that deity. </li>'+
'<li>A person who seeks prosperity shall worship Parvati who bestows all worldly pleasures on Mondays, Navami (ninth) day, and in the star of Mrgasiras in the month of Karkataka. </li>'+
'<li>The Navami in the bright half of the month of Asvayuj accords all desired benefits. The worship of Siva shall be performed on Sundays, Caturdasi (fourteenth) day of the dark half of the month of Magha on the Ardra star and on the Mahardra day. It accords all cherished desires. </li>'+
'<li>The worship is conducive to longevhy, prevents premature death and accords the achievement of everything. The worship of the different manifestations of Siva with all sixteen forms of service and homage on the Mahardra day in the month of Jyestha, on Caturdasi day or on the Ardra day in the month of Margasirsa is on a par with Siva\'s worship and yields worldly enjoyment and salvation. The worship of the first deity of the week days in the month of Kartika is specially recommended. </li>'+
'<li>When the month of Kartika has arrived, the sensible man shall worship all the deities by giving gifts and observing austerities, homas, Japas, restraints and the sixteen forms of service. The idol shall be worshipped with mantras. Brahmins shall be fed. The devotee shall be freed of desires and distresses. </li>'+
'<li>The worship of deities in the month of Kartika yields all worldly pleasures, dispels all ailments and removes the adverse effects of spirits and evil planets. </li>'+
'<li>The worship of the sun on Sundays in the month of Kartika together with the gifts of gingelly seeds and cotton alleviates leprosy etc. </li>'+
'<li>By making gifts of Haritaki ( one of the myro balans), chillies, cloth, milk etc. and by installing Brahman, the alleviation of consumption is brought about. </li>'+
'<li>By making gifts of lamps and mustard seeds epileptic fits are alleviated. The worship of Siva on Mondays in the month of Kartika suppresses excessive poverty and increases prosperity. The worship of Skanda on Tuesdays in the month of Kartika, and making gifts of houses, fields, domestic articles and utensils, lamps, bells etc. the devotee gains eloquence without delay. </li>'+
'<li>The worship of Visnu on Wednesdays in the month of Kartika together with the gift of cooked rice with curds yields good progeny. </li>'+
'<li>The worship of Brahman on Thursdays in the month of Kartika and the gift of honey, gold and ghee affords the increase of worldly pleasures. </li>'+
'<li>The worship of the elephant-faced Ganesa<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (80)</note> together with the gifts of scented flowers affords the enjoyment of worldly pleasures</li>'+
'<li>Even a barren woman gets a good son making gifts of gold, silver etc. The worship of the guardians of the quarters, the elephants of the quarters, the serpents, the guardians of dams, the three-eyed<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (81)</note> Rudra and Visnu, the remover of sins, bestows perfect knowledge. The worship of Brahman, Dhanvantari<noteref3_note3footer>(3) - (82)</note> and of the twin deities-Asvins<noteref4_note4footer>(4) - (83)</note> alleviates ailments, prevents foul death and suppresses all sickness instantaneously. </li>'+
'<li>Gifts of salt, iron, oil, pulses, Trikatuka, fruits, scents, drinking water etc., liquids in prastha measures and solids in pala weights enable the devotee to attain heaven. The worship of Siva and others early in the morning in the month of Dhanus enables the devotees to achieve everything gradually. The offering of eatables shall preferably be gheesoaked rice of the Sali variety and well-cooked. </li>'+
'<li>The offering of various kinds of cooked rice is specially recommended in the month of Dhanus. The person who gives cooked food in the month of Margasira shall attain all desired benefits. </li>'+
'<li>The giver of cooked food in the month of Margasira shall attain destruction of sins, achievement of the desired objects, good health, virtue, good comprehension of the Vedic passages, good practices, great enjoyment here and hereafter, the permanent unification with the Godhead and the realisation of the perfect knowledge of the Vedanta. </li>' +
'<li>A person who desires enjoyment of worldly pleasures shall worship the deities early in the morning throughout the month of Margasira or at least for three days. No one shall be without sacred rites in the month of Dhanus. </li>'+
'<li>Rites in Dhanurmasa (month of Dhanus) prescribed for the morning can be performed upto the Sangava time (3 muhurtas from sunrise). A brahmin shall observe fast in the month of Dhanus and restrain all his senses. Till midday he shall repeat the Gayatri mantra. Till the time of going to bed, he shall repeat the mantras such as the £ve-syllabled one etc. After acqujring perfect knowledge he shall attain salvation after death. Other men and women shall repeat the five-syllabled mantra alone throughout and take three baths every day. They will attain perfect knowledge. They shall secure the annihilation of the great sins by repeating their favourite mantras. </li>'+
'<li>The great offering of eatables shall be made to Siva especially in the month of Dhanus. The constituent parts of the great offering are as follows:Rice of the Sali variety a Bhara by weight; pepper measuring a prastha; countable articles twelve in number; honey and ghee a kugava each; a drona measure of green gram; twelve varieties of side dishes; cake fried in ghee, sweets made of Salika rice; curd and milk twelve prasthas each; twelve coconuts; twelve betel nuts, thirtysix clove leaves; camphor powder; five saugandika<noteref5_note1footer>(5) - (84)</note> flowers; betal leaves. </li>'+
'<li>This great offering of eatables made to the deities shall be distributed among devotees in the order of their castes. </li>'+
'<li>A devotee who makes the offering of cooked rice becomes the Lord of a kingdom in the world. But by making gift of great offering of eatables, a man attains heaven. </li>'+
'<li>0 excellent brahmins, by offering this a thousand times the devotee attains Satyaloka and lives the full span of life therein. </li>' +
'<li>By offering this twenty-thousand times, he attains still higher world and is not born again . </li>'+
'<li>Twenty-six thousand great offerings constitute life-time offering. Making gift of this is called great accomplishment. A devotee who makes this is not born again. </li>'+
'<li>In the month of Karttika, on an auspicious day, life-time offering shall be made. It shall be done at the time of the transit of the sun, on birthdays (based on star), on full-1noon days, annual birthdays etc. In other months when the natal star comes in conjunction with the planets, this can be performed. </li>'+
'<li>Even if the conjunction is only partial the offering shall be made. One gets the benefit of dedicating oneself by that. </li>'+
'<li>Siva is delighted by the dedication of selves. and bestows the salvation of complete identity. This life-time offering shall be made only to Siva. 86. Siva exemplifies birth in as much as He has the form of both Yoni (vaginal passage) and Liilga (Penis). Hence in order to ward off births the Janmapuja is of Siva alone. </li>'+
'<li>The entire universe consisting of the movable and the immovable is of the nature of Bindu (dot) and Nada (sound). Bindu is Sakti {Power) and Siva is Nada. Hence the universe is pervaded by Siva and Sakti.</li>' +
'<li>88. Bindu<noteref6_note6footer>(6) - (85)</note> is the support of Nada.<noteref7_note7footer>(7) - (86)</note> The universe has the support of Bindu. Both Bindu and Nada together support the entire universe. </li>'+
'<li> The unification of the Bindu and the Nada is called Sakalikarana and the universe takes its birth as a result of this Sakalikarana. </li>'+
'<li>The Phallic emblem is the Nada and is the cause of the universe. and Siva is the Nada and the fusion phallic emblem of Siva. </li>' +
'<li>Hence to ward off future births, the devotee shall worship the phallic emblem of Siva. Goddess of the form of Bindu is the mother and Siva of the form of Nada is the father. </li>'+
'<li>Great bliss is the result of the worship of the parents. The de,rotee shall worship the phallic emblem for the acquisition of the Great Bliss. 93. That goddess is the mother of the universe and that Siva is the father of the universe. Sympathy towards the son who renders service naturally increases in the minds of the parents. </li>'+
'<li>0 foremost among sages, ordinary parents bestow hidden treasures to the son who renders special service. Hence a devotee shall worship the phallic emblem in the manner of mother and father for the acquisition of the hidden great bliss. Bharga is Purusa (Cosmic man or Being) and Bharga is Prakrti (Cosmic Nature). </li>'+
'<li>Purusa is of hidden latent conception and Prakrti is of manifest inner conception. </li>'+
'<li>Since it is the father who conceives first, the Purusa has the primordial conception. The unification of Purusa and Pralqti is the first birth. </li>'+
'<li>Its manifestation in the Prakrti is called the second birth. The creature, dead even as it is born, takes up its birth from the Purusa. </li>'+
'<li>Certainly the birth is induced by the Maya as an extraneous source. The word Jiva (the individual soul) means that which gets decayed even from the time of birth. </li>'+
'<li>Another meaning of the word Jiva is that which is born enmeshed and entwined. Hence the devotee shall worship the primordial phallic image for unravelling the knots and nooses of the birth. </li>'+
'<li>The world bhaga means the primordial nature because it increases and flourishes. The Sabdamatra etc. (the cosmic sound principle i.e. all objects of enjoyment) evolved out of Prakrti, being enjoyed by the sense organs; the word Bhoga comes to mean that which gives Bhaga. The principal Bhaga is of course the Pra]qti and Bhagavan is Lord Siva Himself</li>' +
'<li>The lord alone is the bestower of enjoyment ( Bhoga) and not anyone else. The Lord who is the master of Bhaga is called Bharga by wise men. </li>'+
'<li>The phallus is united with vagina and vagina is united with phallus. For the sake of perpetual enjoyment here and hereafter the devotee shall worship the phallic emblem which is lord Siva Himself. He is the sun giving birth and sustenance to the worlds. His symbol is justified in the coming into existence of things. </li>'+
'<li>Persons should worship Siva, the cause of birth, in his phallic form. That which makes the Purusa known, is called Linga, the symbol. The unification and fusion of the symbols of Siva and Sakti is thus called Linga. </li>'+
'<li>The lord delighted at the worship of His symbol wards off the function of the symbol. That function being birth etc, birth etc. cease. </li>'+
'<li>Hence the devotee shall worship the phallic emblem with the sixteen forms of service and homage to acquire the benefit from Prakrti and Purusa through means inherent or extraneous. </li>'+
'<li>The worship thus performed on Sundays wards off births. The devotee shall worship the great phallic emblem on Sundays with the syllable Om. </li>'+
'<li>The ceremonial ablution of the phallic emblem with Paficagavya on Sundays is specially recommended. Paficagavya is the compound of cow\'s urine, dung, milk, curd and ghee. Milk, curd and ghee can severally be used with honey and molasses. The offering of rice cooked in cow\'s milk must be made with the syllable Om. </li>'+
'<li>The syllable Om (a+u+m) is Dhvani Linga The svayambhii linga is Nada Liriga; the Yantra (diagrammatic contrivance) is Bindulinga. "M" syllable is the installed {Prati~thita) liriga. "U" syllable is mobile (Cara) Liriga and the "A" syllable is a Linga of huge form (Guruvigraha). A person who worships the lingas perpetually becomes liberated soul undoubtedly. </li>'+
'<li> A devout worship of Siva liberates man from the bondage of births. A fourth benefit is achieved by wearing Rudraksa beads sacred to Siva and a moiety is achieved by smearing the holy ashes over the forehead. Three-fourths can be achieved by the recital of mantras and a man becomes full-fledged devotee by mearts of worship. A man who worships both the phallic emblem of Siva and the devotees of Siva attains salvation. comes full-fledged devotee by mearts of worship. A man who worships both the phallic emblem of Siva and the devotees of Siva attains salvation. comes full-fledged devotee by mearts of worship. A man who worships both the phallic emblem of Siva and the devotees of Siva attains salvation. </li>'+
'<li>0 brahmins, stable devotion can be found firmly established and flourishing only in that person who reads this chapter or listens to it attentively.</li></ol>' + '<br/><a href=\'#top\'><strong>Back To Top</strong></a></p>',

The human element is represented by those legends which refer to the wonderful cures effected by them. The cosmic element relates to their luminous nature.

'<li> All of you, sages, have now requested for a good thing. Only Siva can explain this properly. No one else. </li>'+
'<li>Still I shall explain the same with Siva\'s grace. May Siva increasingly guard us, you and every one else. </li>'+
'<li>The syllable Om means an excellent boat to cross the ocean of worldly existence. [Pra=of the Prakrti i.e. the world evolved out of it. Navam-Navam Varam-an excellent boat] </li>'+
'<li>Or Pranava may mean: "there is no world for you" or it may mean "That which leads to salvation". </li>'+
'<li>Or it may mean "that which leads to new knowledge." After annihilating all actions it gives the persons who repeat the mantra or worship, a fresh knowledge of the pure soul. This Pranava is two-fold {1) the subtle (2) the gross. </li>'+
'<li>The subtle one is of a single syllable where the constituent five syllables are not differentiated clearly. The gross one is of five syllables where all the constituent syllables are manifest. </li>'+
'<li>The subtle one is for the liberated living soul (jivanmukta). The need for the contemplation of the meaning through the mantra is only upto the destruction of the physical body. </li>'+
'<li>When the body is destroyed he completely merges in Siva undoubtedly. The mere repeater of the mantra attains the yogic communion with Siva certainly. </li>'+
'<li>A person who repeats the mantra thirty-six crores of times certainly attains the yogic communion. The subtle Pranava is again two-fold-the short, and the long. </li>'+
'<li>The long one is present in the heart of the Yogins alone-separately in the form of "A" syllable, "U" syllable, "M" syllable, Bindu and Nada. It is endowed with all the digits of the time sound. Siva, Sakti and their unio~ are indicated by ":M" syllable ramified into three and this is called the short subtle Pranava. The short Pranava shall be recited and repeated by those who desire their all sins annihilated. </li>'+
'<li>The five elements ether, air, fire, water and earth and their five subtle causes sound, touch, form, taste, and smell together activised in relation to achievement of desires are called Pravrttas. The short subtle Pranava is for those who desire the continuation of mundane existence and the long one is for those who are 1 averse to the same.<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (87)</note> The Pranava is to be used in the beginning of the Vyahrtis,<noteref2_note2footer>(2) - (88)</note> mantras, in the beginning of the Vedas, and during the prayer at dawn and at dusk along with Bindu and Nada. If the devotee repeats it nine crores of times he becomes pure. </li>'+
'<li>A further repetition for nine crores of times enables him to win over the Earth element. A further repetition for nine crores of ti~es enables him to win over the water element. </li>'+
'<li>Similarly for each repetition of nine· crores of times he is able to win over the elements of fire, wind and the ether. </li>'+
'<li>The attributes of "smell" etc. are to be similarly won over by successive repetitions of nine crores of times. The egotism is to be won over by another repetition of nine crores of times. </li>'+
'<li>By repeating it daily for a thousand times the devotee becomes perpetually pure. 0 brahmins, thereafter the repetition of the mantra is conducive to the achievement of desires. </li>'+
'<li>A devotee who thus completes one hundered and eight crores of Japas of Pranava (Om) and IS thus fully enlightened shall master Suddhayoga. </li>'+
'<li>A person who has thus mastered Suddhayoga becomes certainly a liberated living soul. A Mahayogin who performs Japas and meditations perpetually of Siva in the form of Pranava and maintains mystic trance, certainly becomes Siva Himself. He must perform Japas after duly performing the Ailganyasa (ritualistic placing of the finger over the different parts of the body as prescribed) and invoke the sages concerned, the deities presiding over and the name of the metre in which the verse is composed. </li>'+
'<li>The devotee who practises the Japa of Pranava (Om) with due ritualistic placings of fingers on the parts of his body becomes a sage. He shall attain all the benefits of the ritualistic Nyasa such as the blessings of ten mothers and the (attainment of) six pathways. </li>'+
'<li>As for those who are devoted to activities and those who both refrain from and indulge in activities, the gross Pranava is recommended. Sivayogins are of three types being devoted to rites, austerities and Japas. The Kriyayogin is the one who engages himself in sacred rites and worship spending money, using limbs of the body and uttering words N amaha (obeisance) etc. Tapoyogin is the one who desists from injuring others, restains all external sense organs, takes limited quantities of food and performs worships. Japayogin is the one who is quiet, performs Japa always, is free from all sorts of desires and maintains all these observances mentioned before. </li>'+
'<li>A pure man shall obtain liberation only step by step, beginning with Salokya as a result of being purified by the worship of Sivayogins with sixteen services and homage. </li>' +
'<li>0 brahmins, I shall now explain Japayoga, please listen. Even the person practising austerities shall perform Japas to purify himself. </li>'+
'<li>0 brahmins, the five-syllabled mantra of Siva is the gross Pranava. The name Siva is used in the dative case with Namah preflxed. (Namah Sivaya-Homage to Siva) It implies the five principles. </li>'+
'<li>The Japa of the five-syllabled mantra shall always be performed along with Pranava. A man can achieve every~ thing by means of the Japa of the five-syllabled mantra. </li>'+
'<li>0 brahmins, the devotee shall take instruction from his preceptor, sit comfortably on the ground cleaned well, and start the Japa. The practice shall start on the Caturdasi day of the bright half and concluded on the Caturdasi day of the dark half. </li>'+
'<li>The months of Magha and Bhadrapada are the most auspicious of all occasions. During the days of Japa he shall take only a single meal during the day in limited quantities. He shall abstain from useless talk and curb all his sense organs. He shall uninterruptedly render service to his parents and the king, or any master whom he serves. By performing the Japa a thousand times, he shall be free from indebtedness, otherwise not. </li>'+
'<li>The five-syllabled mantra shall be repeated five hundred thousand times, all the time remembering the various aspects of Lord Siva who is seated in the lotus pose. <br/>&nbsp;- He is the bestower of all auspiciousness. <br/>&nbsp;- He has the crescent moon for his coronet. <br/>&nbsp;- He has given shelter to Ganga in His matted hair. <br/>&nbsp;- With Sakti seated on His left thigh, He shines with His great concourse of attendants around Him. <br/>&nbsp;- He bears the moon (on his forehead). <br/>&nbsp;- He shows the gestures of bestowing boons and offering freedom from fear. <br/>&nbsp;- He is the cause of perpetual blessing. <br/>&nbsp;- He is Sadasiva. <br/>&nbsp;- He shall be mentally worshipped at first or as stationed in the heart or in the solar zone. <br/>' +
'<li>While performing the Japa of the five-syllabled mantra he shall sit facing the east. All his actions shall be pure. In the morning of the Caturdasi day of the dark half, after finishing the daily dtes he shall sit in a clean beautiful place. He shall control his mind and senses. He shall repeat the five-syllabled mantra twelve thousand times in this way. </li>' +
'<li>For the sake of the worship he shall invite five great devotees of Siva along with their wives. One of those · shall be an excellent preceptor who shall be assigned the Samba form, another will represent Isana, the third will represent the Aghora aspect of Siva, the fourth will represent the Varna aspect of Siva and the fifth will represent "Sadyojbita" aspect of Siva. </li>'+
'<li>All the articles for the worship shall be ready and the worship shall start. When it is performed duly, the sacrifice shall follow. All the rites from the beginning to the end shall be performed according to the rules laid down in the scriptural code which the devotee follows. The ghee used shall be the one prepared from the milk of a tawny cow. He shall make ten, hundred or a thousand offerings or he shall bid the devotees of Siva make the offerings. In that case the offerings are one hundred and eight in number. </li>'+
'<li>At the end of the sacrifice monetary gifts shall be given: the preceptor shall be given two cows (or a cow and a bull) as extra. The five devotees shall be duly worshipped; the householder shall take bath with the water wherewith the feet of the devotees shall be washed. He shall thereby reap the benefit of taking bath in 36 crores of holy rivers and tanks. </li>'+
'<li>He shall make gifts of cooked rice and ten ancillary constituents with great piety. The preceptor\'s wife must be considered as the great goddess (Para.) The wives of the other devotees Isana and the rest shall be duly worshipped and honoured. They shall be presented with the beads sacred to Siva, garments, and sumptuously fed with milk pudding, pulse, pies, sweet pies etc. after the oblations are duly given. The Japa is then concluded with due prayers to the lord of gods. </li>'+
'<li>After the performance of Purascarana (repetition of the mantra followed by sacrifice), the householder becomes endowed with the efficacy of the mantra. If he completes another five · hundred thousand J a pas, all the sins will be wiped oft. </li>'+
'<li> For every set of five hundred thousand Japas the householder shall be blessed with the riches and prosperity of the different Lokas beginning with Atala and ending with Satyaloka in order. </li>'+
'<li>If the householder dies in the middle, he shall be reborn in the world after due enjoyment of pleasures in the other worlds. He shall then continue the Japa and derive the benefit of being near to Brahman. </li>'+
'<li>After a repetition of five hundred thousand further Japas he derives the benefit of assimilation to Brahman. If ten million Japas are completed in all he shall become identical with Brahman. · </li>'+
'<li>Thus attaining the absorption into Karyabrahman {the action Brahman) he gains all such enjoyments as can be wished for till the time of final dissolution. </li>'+
'<li>In the Next Kalpa he will be born as Brahma\'s son. Becoming illuminated with the penance he shall be ultimately liberated. </li>'+
'<li>Fourteen worlds beginning with Patala and ending with Satya are evolved out of the five elements, such as the Earth etc. These are called Brahma\'s worlds. </li>'+
'<li>There are fourteen Visnu worlds beyond Satya world and ending with Ksama. In the Ksama world the action-Visnu is stationed in the excellent city of Vaikuintha in the company of action-Laksmi ·protecting the great recipients of enjoyment, Beyond that and ending with Suciloka there are twenty-eight worlds. </li>'+
'<li>In the pure world of Kailasa, Rudra, the annihilator of the living beings, is stationed~ Beyond that are the fifty-six worlds ending with Ahirhsa region. </li>'+
'<li>The action-lord who has screened everything is stationed in the city of Jnanakailasa in the Ahirhsa region. </li>'+
'<li>At the end of the same is the wheel of Time and beyond the ken of Time there is the space called KiHatita. There Kala (God of death and Time) backed by Sjva and in the name of Cakresvara, unites every one with Time. In his activity he occupies Dharma in the form of a buffalo whose four legs are untruth, untidiness, violence and ruthlessness. He can assume any form he wishes. He assumes the form of a great buffalo, is rich in Atheism, has evil association and utters sounds other than those of the V~das. He has an active association with Anger. He is black in colour. He is called great lord (Mahesvara) to that extent. The ability to vanish is up to that extent. </li>'+
'<li>Beneath that is the Karmabhoga enjoyment as a result of activity. Beyond that point is Jnanabhoga (enjoyment due to knowledge). Beneath that point is Karmamaya and beyond that point is Jnanamaya. </li>'+
'<li> Explanation of Karmamaya-Ma means Laksmi i.e. Karmabhoga. Attainment of the same is Maya. The word Ma is then interpreted as Jnanabhoga. Attainment of the same is Maya. </li>'+
'<li>Beyond that point is Nityabhoga (perpetual enjoyment). Beneath that point is Nasvarabhoga (evanescent enjoyment) . Beneath that is evanescence and beyond that there is freedom. </li>'+
'<li>The bondage of nooses is only beneath that point. There is no bondage beyond that. Those who perform actions with desire alone, hover beneath that point. </li>'+
'<li>The enjoyment of rites performed with no desire is said to be beyond that point. Those who are devoted to the worship of womb, hover beneath that. </li>'+
'<li>The worshippers of the phallic emblem who are unaffected by desire can go beyond that. Worshippers of deities other than Siva, hover beneath that. </li>'+
'<li>Those who are devoted to Siva alone can go beyond that. Crores of Jivas live beneath that point. There is a great fort-wall as it were above the same. </li>'+
'<li>Persons bound by worldly existence remain beneath that point and those who are liberated go beyond that. Those who worship the natural substances hover beneath that. </li>'+
'<li>Those who worship the entity of Purusa go beyond that point. Saktilinga is beneath that point but Sivaliriga is beyond.</li>'+
'<li>The unmanifest linga is beneath that point but the manifest one is beyond. The conceived linga is beneath and the unconceived one is beyond. </li>'+
'<li>The external linga is beneath that point and the internal one is beyond. The Saktilokas numbering hundred and twelve are beneath that point. </li>'+
'<li>The Binduriipa is beneath that point and Nadariipa is beyond. The Karmaloka is beneath that point and Jnanaloka is beyond that. </li>'+
'<li>Obeisance which is beyond that point quells pride and egotism. The word Jan means evanescence, Na is a negative particle. The word Jnana, therefore, means that · which wards off evanescence. Those who worship elements hover beneath that point. </li>'+
'<li>And those who worship spiritual things go beyond that point. The Vedibhaga (the portion of the Altar) in that great world of Atmalinga is only up to that point. The eight fixation of Prakrti etc. is also at the extremity of the Vedi. Such is the customary and the scriptural procedure. </li>'+
'<li>Those who are endowed with the virtue of truthfulness etc. and those who are devoted to the worship of Siva cross Kalacakra who is seated on Adharmamahisa (The buffalo of evils). </li>'+
'<li>Beyond that stands, ahead of Sivaloka, the bull of Virtue in the form of celibacy. It has the legs of Truthfulness etc. </li>'+
'<li>The bull of Dharma has forbearance for its horns, restraint for its ears, faith for its eyes, sighs for its intellect and mind. It is embellished by the sound of Vedic chants. </li>'+
'<li>The bulls of sacred rites etc. are to he understood as stationed in the causes. Kalatita (i.e Mahesvara) presides over the bull of sacred rites. </li>'+
'<li>The span of life of Brahma, Visnu and Mahesa is a day. Beyond that, there is neither day nor night, neither birth nor death. </li>'+
'<li>The worlds ending with Karanasatya, of the Karanabrahma ( Brahma the cause) evolved out of the subtle elements, Smell etc. are stationed beyond it. In all these fourteen worlds, the subtle smell etc. give the due form. The fourteen worlds of Karanavisnu are stationed there. </li>'+
'<li>The lokas of Karanarudra are twenty-eight in number. The lokas of Karana-iSa numbering fifty-six are beyond that. </li>'+
'<li>The Brahmacaryaloka accepted by Siva is ·beyond that. There in the Jnanakailasa that has five coverings, the primary phallic from of Siva is stationed in the company of primary energy of Siva. It has five zones and five Brahmakalas. </li>'+
'<li>This is called the abode of Siva, Sivalaya, the supreme Atman. There alone stays Paramesvara in the company of Parasakti. </li>'+
'<li>He is skilled in the performance of the five functions of creation, maintenance evanescence and blessing. His body is Existence, Knowledge and Bliss. </li>'+
'<li>He is always in meditation. He is ever bent on blessing. He is seated in the pose of trance. He shines resting in his own self </li>'+
'<li>His vision is possible gradually through sacred rites, meditation etc. By performing the daily rites and worships, the mind is diverted towards the sacred rites of Siva the performance whereof gives the sight of Siva. Those who come within His vision are certainly liberated. </li>'+
'<li>The liberation is in the form of realising the nature of Atman. It is a relaxation and resting in one\'s own soul. It is based on sacred rites, penance, Japa, knowledge, meditation and virtue. </li>'+
'<li>Relaxation is assured at the vision of Siva. Siva, the merciful, removes ignorance even as the sun removes all impurities and darkness by means of its rays. When ignorance is dispelled, the knowledge of Siva begins to function. </li>'+
'<li>On acquiring the knowledge of Siva a person achieves relaxation. He becomes gratified at the acquisition of relaxation. </li>'+
'<li>Again by means of ten million Japas he acquires Brahma\'s region. A further ten million Japas enable him to achieve Visnu\'s region. By a further ten million japas he attains Rudra\'s region and by a further ten million japas ISvara\'s region is attained. </li>'+
'<li>Again by a similar japa performed with concentration he attains Kalacakra, the first in the Sivaloka. </li>'+
'<li>The Kalacakra consists of five wheels, one being over the other. Sight and delusion (Dqti and Moha) constitute the Brahmacakra; Enjoyment and delusion (Bhoga and Moha) constitute the Visnu Chakra. Anger and delusion(Kopa and Moha) constitute the Raudra Cakra, Revolution ( Bhramat).a) is lsvaracakra. Knowledge and illusion (Jnana and Moha) constitute the Sivacakra. Thus scholars have explained the five cakras. </li>'+
'<li>Then by ten crores of Japas he achieves the region of Karana Brahman. Again by ten crores he attains the prosperity of that. region. </li>'+
'<li>Thus, gradually, attaining the region of Visnu and those of other Gods as well as the prosperities of those regions, completing assiduously the repetitions to the tune of hundred and five crores of times, he attains Sivaloka outside ·the fifth sheath. </li>'+
'<li>There is a Silver platform there, an excellent river bed, and a bull in the form of penance. </li>'+
'<li>The fifth sheath is the excellent station of SadyoJata (a form of Siva). The fourth is the station of Vamadeva. </li>'+
'<li>The third is the abode of Aghora. The second is the abode of Samba Purusa. </li>'+
'<li>The first is the abode of Isana. The fifth is the place of Dhyana Dharma (virtue of meditation). </li>'+
'<li>The abode of Balinatha is the bestower of the full Amrta (deathlessness, nectaF). Thereafter is the fourth Mandapa with the idol of Candrasekhara (a form of Siva). </li>'+
'<li>The abode of Somaskanda is the third mandapa. The faithfuls say that the second Mandapa is the NrtyaMandapa. </li>'+
'<li>The first Mandapa is the abode of Mulamaya (primary delusion) and is very auspicious and stationed there itself. Beyond that is the sanctum sanctorum, the auspicious place of the phallic form of Siva. </li>'+
'<li>No one can realise the flourishing power of Siva stationed at the back of Nandi. Nandisvara sits outside and repeats the five-syllabled mantra. </li>'+
'<li>This knowledge has come down from the preceptors. I got it from NandiSa. Beyond this, it must be inferred from it and it is actually experienced only by Siva. </li>'+
'<li>The full grandeur and greatness of Sivaloka can be known by any one only out of the grace of Siva and not otherwise, so say the faithfuls. </li>'+
'<li>It is thus that Brahmins of controlled sense-organs become liberated gradually. I shall tell you the process in some other cases. Please listen attentively. </li>'+
'<li>Brahmin women must take instruction from a preceptor and perform the Japa with Namah. at the end. They shall repeat the five-syllabled mantra five hundred thousand times for their longevity. That is the rule. Again they must repeat it five hundred thousand times to wipe off womanhood. Becoming a man first, the liberation will be acquired gradually. </li>'+
'<li>A Ksatriya must repeat the mantra five hundred thousand times to remove Ksatratva. A further repetition of five hundred thousand times enables him to become a brahmin. </li>'+
'<li>After the mantrasiddhi he shall gradually become liberated. A Vaisya dispels the Vaisyatva by five hundred thousand japas. </li>'+
'<li>Then he becomes a mantra-Ksatriya by repeating it five hundred thousand times. He then dispels the Ksatratva by five hundred thousand japas. </li>'+
'<li>He then becomes a mantrabrahmin by repeating the mantra five hundred thousand times. A Sudra, repeating the mantra with· Namah. at the end, for two million five hundred thousand times becomes a mantrabrahmin and so pure enough for liberation. If one is sick, whether man or woman, of brahmin caste or otherwise, one must repeat it always with Namah in the beginning or at the end. As for the women, the preceptor shall instruct them in proper order. </li>'+
'<li>At the end of every five hundred thousand Japas, the aspirant shall perform Mahabhiseka and Naivedya. He shall worship devotees of Siva for gratifying Siva. </li>'+
'<li>Siva becomes delighted at the worship of the devotee. There is no difference between Siva and the devotee of Siva. He is Siva Himself. </li>'+
'<li>The mantra is of the nature of Siva. By holding the mantra the physical body of the devotee becomes identified with Siva. </li>'+
'<li> Devotees of Siva know all the rites, nay all the Vedic rites. The more an aspirant repeats the mantra of Siva, the greater is the presence of Siva in his .body. For the woman devotee of Siva, the symbol of the goddess shall be the form for concentration. </li>'+
'<li>The presence of the Goddess continues to be felt as long as the mantra continues to be repeated. An intelligent man who continues to worship Siva becomes worthy of the name and form. </li>'+
'<li>Even when the aspirant has become Siva he shall worship the Para. He shall worship Sakti, the embodied and the phallic form of Siva after faultlessly making images of the same. </li>'+
'<li>He shall consider the phallic form as Siva and himself as Sakti or he shall consider Saktilinga as the goddess and himself as Siva or he shall consider Sivalinga in the form of Nada and Sakti in the form of Bindu and give the primary or secondary character to either or consider both united together. Whatever be the form of Upasti, he shall worship both Siva and Sakti. He becomes Siva in virtue of his basic realisation. With the sixteen forms of service and homage, he shall worship devotees of Siva who are verily the mantra of Siva personified or identical with Siva. He will thereby achieve whatever he desires. Siva being highly pleased with him yield~ to his gratification. Without being undeceptive in regard to money, body, mantra or the conception he shall gratify five, ten or hundred couples of Siva\'s devotees by feeding them and rendering them other services, in the company of his wife. </li>'+
'<li> He will assume the form of Siva and Sakti and will not be born again. Just below the umbilicus is the part of Brahma, till the armpit is the part of Visnu and the face is the phallus in the body of a devotee of Siva. If any one dies, the. householder shall worship the primordial father Siva, the primordial mother Siva and the devotees of Siva. Thereby, whether the dead body is properly cremated or not, the dead man shall go to the world of the manes and gradually attain salvation. A person endowed with Tapas is far better than ten persons endowed with rites. </li>'+
'<li>A person endowed with Japa is superior to a hundred persons endowed with Tapas. A person endowed with the knowledge of Siva is superior to a thousand persons endowed with Japas. A person endowed with meditation is superior to a hundred thousand persons who have the knowledge of Siva. A person endowed with the power of trance is superior to a crore of meditating persons. Since the latter are superior to the former they shall be selected for worship. Even sensible persons cannot fully comprehend the excellence of benefit. An ordinary man cannot understand the greatness of the devotee of Siva. The worship of the devotee of Siva is on a par with the worship of Siva and Sakti. He who worships any of these piously becomes Siva and attains Siva. He who reads this significant chapter, that agrees with the Vedic injunctions, becomes a brahmin endowed with the knowledge of Siva and rejoices in the company of Siva. 0 scholarly lords of sages, a person who knows special things must narrate them to the devotees of Siva. By Siva\'s grace he will be blessed</li></ol>' + '<br/><a href=\'#top\'><strong>Back To Top</strong></a></p>',

'<ol><li> 0 foremost among those who know everytliing, please explain the nature of bondage and liberation. </li>'+
'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:green;font-size:larger"> Suta said:  </span><br/>' +
'I shall explain bondage, liberation and the means of liberation. Please listen attentively<br/>' +
'<li>A Jiva is said to be in bondage if he is tied up by the noose of eightfold primary essences, Prakrti etc. When freed from them he is called liberated.</li>' +
'<li>Perfect control and subjugation of Prakrti and its offshoots is Salvation. A Jiva in bondage when freed from it is called a liberated soul. </li>' +
'<li>The set of eight that binds is :-Prakrti, Buddhi (cosmic intellect), Ahamkara (cosmic ego) of the nature of attributes, and the five Tanmatras (cosmic principles of Ether etc.) </li>'+
'<li>The body is evolved out of these eight. The body carries on activities. The activities generate the body. Thus birth and activities continue in a series. </li>' +
'<li>The body is of three types: the gross, the subtle and the causal. The gross body is responsible for all activities; the subtle body yields the enjoyment of pleasures through the senses. . The causal body is for the sake of experiencing the good and bad results of the activities of the Jiva. The Jiva experiences happiness as a result of virtue and misery as a result of sin. </li>' +
'<li>The Jiva bound by the rope of activities revolves round and round for ever like a wheel by means of the three types of body and their activities. </li>' +
'<li>The creator of the wheel must be worshipped for the cessation of the revolution of the wheel. The Prakrti etc. constitute the great wheel and Siva is beyond the Prakrti. </li>' +
'<li>The creator of the wheel is the Lord Siva. He is beyond the Prakrti. Just as a boy drinks or spits out water as he pleases so also Siva keeps Prak:rti etc. just as he pleases. He is called Siva because he has brought it under his control. (Vasikrta). Siva alone is omniscient, perfect and free from desire. </li>' +
'<li>The mental prowess of Mahesvara which Vedas alone can comprehend consists of omniscience, satiety, beginningless understanding, independence, never failing and and infinite power. . </li>' +
'<li>Hence Prakirti etc. came under control due to Siva\'s grace. One shall worship Siva alone for the acquisition of Siva\'s grace. </li>' +
'<li>If one were to ask "How can there be a self-less worship of a perfect being?" the answer is "An activity done with dedication to Siva shall cause pleasure to him". </li>' +
'<li>Keeping Siva in view the devotee shall worship the phallic or the embodied image of Siva, or his devotee. He shall worship his devotee by means of the body, mind, speech and money spent. </li>' +
'<li>Siva, the great lord, who is beyond Prakrti is delighted at the worship and specially blesses the worshipper. </li>' +
'<li>The Karma etc. come under control gradually due to Siva\'s grace. Beginning with Karma and ending with Prak:rti when everything comes under control, the Jiva is called liberated and he shines as a self-realised person. By the grace of Siva, when this body which is resultant from activities (Karmadeha) comes under control, the devotee attains residence in Sivaloka. This is called Salokya form of liberation. When the subtle elements come under control, the devotee attains nearness to Siva</li>'+
'<li>Then he attains similarity with Siva by means of weapons and activities. This is called Sarupya. When the devotee acquires the great favour, the cosmic intellect too comes under control. </li>' +
'<li>The cosmic intellect is only an effect of the Prakrti. The control of Intellect is called Sarsti - a form of liberation wherein the devotee has the same rank and power as Siva. Then due to a further great favour of Siva, the Prakrti comes under control. </li>' +
'<li>The mental prowess of Siva becomes his without any difficulty. On acquiring the omniscience and prosperity of Siva, the devotee becomes resplendent in his soul. This is called Sayujya (complete identity) by persons wellversed in the Vedas and Agamas (Traditional Sacred Texts). It is in this order that one gets salvation by the worship of the phallic image of Siva. </li>' +
'<li>Hence the devotee shall worship Siva by performing sacred rites etc. for the acquisition of Siva\'s favour. Siva\'s sacr~ rites, Siva\'s penance, and the Japas of Siva mantras always. </li>' +
'<li>Knowledge of Siva and meditation on Him shall be practised more and more. The time till retirement to bed, the time till death shall be spent in contemplating over Siva. </li>' +
'<li>He shall adore Siva by means of the "Sadyo" mantras and flowers. He will attain welfare. </li>'+
'<em><span style="font-weight:900;color:#334443;font-size:larger">The Sages Said:  </span><br/>' +
'0 excellent one of good rites, please explain the rules governing worship of Siva in the phallic and other forms.<br/>' +
'<br/><em><span style="font-weight:900;color:green;font-size:larger"> Suta said:  </span><br/>' +
'I shall explain, 0 brahmins, the procedure of the worship of the phallic form, please listen. The first phallic form is the Pra:gava that confers all desires. <br/>' +
'<li>It is called Suksma Pra:gava (the subtle one) if it is Niskala. The Sthula (gross one) is Sakala and it consists of five constituent syllables. </li>' +
'<li>The worship of these two is called a penance. Both of them accord salvation. There are many phallic emblems of Purusa Prakrti. </li>' +
'<li>Siva alone can explain them in detail. No one else. Such as are evolved of Earthly material are known to me which I shall explain to you all. </li>' +
'<li>These are of five types: (I) Svayambhu, ( 2) Bindu, ( 3) Pratisthita, ( 4) Cara, ( 5) Guru Linga. </li>' +
'<li>When he is gladdened by the austerities of devas and sages, Siva in the form of Nada assumes the form of a seed under the ground and suddenly piercing the ground above like a germinating sprout manifests Himself outside and makes His presence felt. Since this emblem is self-raised it is called Svayambhii. </li>' +
'<li>By worshipping it the devotee gains increasing knowledge automatically. In a gold or silver plate or on the ground or an altar, the devotee draws the picture of the phallic emblem, the pure Pranava mantra and shall invoke it with the rites of Pratistha and Avahana. </li>' +
'<li>The Bindu and Nada forms, the stationary or mobile ohes are conceptual but belong to Siva, undoubtedly. </li>' +
'<li>Wherever Siva is sincerely believed to be present, the lord bestows on the devotee the benefit through that alone. The devotee can invoke the lord in a natural immobile thing-a rock or a stump-or an engraved picture and worship Siva by the sixteen Upacharas (services and homage). He will attain supreme power of the lord and by practice gain knowledge. </li>' +
'<li>If the· image is installed with pure mind in a pure altar either by the Gods or the sages for the realisation of the soul, it is called Paurusa and it comes under the category of the installed pha1lic image of Siva.</li>' +
'<li>By a regular worship of this phallic image, the devotee will obtain all Paurusa Aisvaryas (human riches). If great brahmins or ric.h kings install a linga prepared by the artisans, it is called Prati~thita and Prakrta. It accords enjoyment of Prakrta Aisvarya (Natural riches ) to the worshipper. </li>' +
'<li>That which IS forceful and permanent is called Paurusa. That which Is weak and temporary is called Prakrta. </li>' +
'<li>The spiritual cum mobile form is represented by the constituents of the body, viz. the penis, navel, tongue, the tip of the nose, hips etc. </li>' +
'<li>The mountain comes under the Paurusa class and the surface of the world under the Prakrta class. Trees etc. are Paurusa and creepers etc. are Prakrta. </li>' +
'<li>The $astika rice is Prakrta but rice of the Sali variety and wheat are Paurusa. The Aisvarya is Paurusa. It bestows eightfold siddhis viz. Apima etc. </li>' +
'<li>The Prakrta linga bestows good women, riches etc. according to the believers. Now, first of all I shall mention the Rasalinga from among Caralingas. ( Rasalinga is mentioned as the foremost among mobile lirigas). </li>' +
'<li>Rasalinga is a bestower of all wishes to the brahmins. The auspicious Banalinga is a bestower of vast kingdoms to the Ksatriyas. </li>' +
'<li>A gold linga bestows the ownership of vast wealth on the Vaisyas. A Shilalinga (a linga made of rock) bestows great purity on the Sudras. </li>' +
'<li>A crystal linga and a Banalinga bestow all sort of wishes on all. If a devotee does not possess a linga of his own, there is no harm in using another\'s liriga for the purpose of worship. </li>' +
'<li>An Earthly linga shall be used by women especially by those whose husbands are alive. In the case of widows who are engaged in worldly and sacred rites a crystal liriga is recommended. </li>' +
'<li>0 sages of good rites, in the cases of widows whether they be in a childhood, youth or old age, a Rasaliriga is specially recommended if they continue to be holding rites. </li>' +
'<li>A linga of pure crystal bestows all sorts of worldly enjoyment on women. The worship of the pedestal grants all cherished desires of the worshipper in this world. </li>' +
'<li>A ritualist shall perform all the worship in a Vessel. At the conclusion of Abhi~eka (ceremonial bath) the Naivedya consisting of cooked rice of the Sali variety shall be offered. </li>' +
'<li>When the worship is over, the linga shall be kept in a casket and placed separately in the house. Persons who worship their own lingas shall, after the worship is over, offer as food those articles of diet to which they are accustomed. </li>' +
'<li>All non-ritualists shall worship the subtle linga. In the place of floral offerings they shall use sacred ashes for adoration and food. </li>' +
'<li>They shall keep the linga after worship on their head for ever. The ash is of three types, derived from ordinary fire, Vedic fire and Siva fire. </li>' +
'<li>The ash derived from ordinary fire shall be used for the purification of articles of mud, wood or metals and even for grains. </li>' +
'<li>Articles of worship like gingelly seeds, cloths and stale stuffs shall be purified with ashes. </li>' +
'<li>So also the objects defiled by dogs etc. The ashes shall be used with or without water according to necessity. </li>' +
'<li>The ashes resulting from Vedic rites in fire shall be smeared over the forehead at the end of the rites. Since the ashes are purified by the mantras the rite itself takes the form of the ashes. </li>' +
'<li>Hence, applying the ashes is tantamount to assimilating the sacred rite in one\'s own Atman. Bilva twigs shall be burnt repeating the Atma mantra of Aghora. This fire is called Sivagni. The ashes resulting therefrom are called Sivagnija. The dung of a cow, preferably of Kapila. cow, shall be burnt first and then the twigs of Sami, Asvattha, PaHisa, Vata, Aragvadha or Bilva shall be burnt. The ash resulting therefrom is also Sivagnija. Or the twigs shall be burnt in Darbha fire repeating Siva mantra. After straining the ashes with cloth (the fire powder) shall be put in a new pot. </li>' +
'<li>For the sake  of resplendence, the ashs shall be Bhasma (Ash) means that which is honored.Siva formerly did. so. </li>' +
'<li> A king takes the essence of wealth by way of tax, in his kingdom. Men burn plants and take the essence thereof. </li>' +
'<li>The gastirc fire burns different kinds of foodstuffs and with their essence nourishes the body. </li>' +
'<li>Similarly the great lord Siva, the creator of the un· iverse, burns the universe presided over by Him and takes the essence of the same. </li>' +
'<li>After burning the universe He applies the ashes over his body. Under the pretext of annihilation He has taken the essence out of the same. </li>' +
'<li>He assigned the essence to His own body. The essence Akasa (the Ether) constitutes His hair. The essence of the wind principle constitutes His face. </li>' +
'<li>The essence of the Fire principle constitutes His heart, that of the principles of waters the hip and that of the principle ofthe Earth the knees. Thus the other limbs too. </li>' +
'<li>The Tripundraka {the three parallel lines of ash marks over the forehead) is the essence of Trinity: Brahma, Visnu and Rudra. Similarly Mahesvara has retained the essence of everything in the form of Tilaka (the small circular mark) on the forehead. </li>' +
'<li>The word Bhasma means that which has controlled the essence of the whole universe. (\'Bha\' -Vrddhi-flourishing essence. \'Sma\'-Svayam. Manyate-considers his own). </li>' +
'<li>The word Sivs signifies him who controls everything and whom none can control, (Siva Vasi) just as Simha signifies the creature who attacks other animals and whom other animals cannot attack( Simha=Himsa). The word Siva is given another interpretation. The syllable S means Permanent Bliss. The letter "i" means Puru~a (the primordial male energy), the syllable "V a" means Sakti (the primordial female energy) . A harmonious compound of these syllables is Siva. The devotee shall likewise make his own soul a harmonious whole and worship Siva. </li>' +
'<li>Ashes must first be smeared in the dust form and then in the TripuJtctraka form. At the time of worship water is added· to the ashes. For mere sanctification the ashes are used without water. </li>' +
'<li>The devotee, whether it is day or night, whether it . is a man or a woman shall use water with the ashes and wear Tripundara at the time of adoration.</li>' +
'<li>He who has the Tripundra made of ashes with water and performs worship derives the entire benefit of the same, no one else. </li>' +
'<li>Wearing the ashes with Siva\'s mantra he comes out of the limitations of the Asramas. He is called Sivasrami for he is solely devoted to Siva. </li>' +
'<li>Being the devotee of Siva and devoted to his sacred rites he need not observe impurity accruing from death or birth in the family. The characteristic sign of a devotee of Siva is that he has a circular dot of white ashes or mud put by himself or by his preceptor on the top of his forehead. The word Guru ( Preceptor) signifies a person who wards off bad qualities. </li>' +
'<li>He removes all the ill effects of the Rajasaic qualities. He is supreme Siva himself. He is beyond the three Gunas, and assuming the form of the preceptor removes the ill effects of the three Gunas and makes the disciple understand Siva. Hence he is the preceptor of the disciples who have faith. </li>' +
'<li>Hence the intelligent devotee shall know that the physical body of the preceptor is known as Gurulinga the worship of which is service rendered to the preceptor. </li>' +
'<li>The word \'service\' means an obedience to the order through body, mind and speech. A disciple with a pure soul shall of necessity carry out the order of the preceptor risking his life and staking his possessions even if the task is not within his power. The word Sisya (disciple) means a person who is worthy of being ordered about. </li>' +
'<li>Dedicating all he has;. even his body, to the preceptor, the disciple shall offer his food first to the preceptor and then take his food with his permission. </li>' +
'<li>Verily a disciple in virtue of his being subjected to discipline is a son unto the preceptor. Moreover by means of his tongue ( as penis) he discharges the semen in the form of mantra in the vaginal passage of the ears and begets the mantraputra in the form of disciple. The son shall therefore adore his preceptor as father unto him. The real father, the physical begetter, drowns the son in the ocean of worldly existence. But the preceptor, the giver of knowledge, the father of learning enables him to cross that ocean. The disciple shall realise the difference between the two and worship the preceptor sincerely. </li>' +
'<li>The modes of worship of the preceptor are many. He can be given monetary gifts. He can be physically served but the money shall be what is earned by the disciple. Since every limb of the preceptor is a phallus from toe to the head, massaging the feet, presenting him with sandals, bathing him, offering food and money and similar rites shall be performed to gratify him. </li>' +
'<li>Verily the worship of the preceptor is worship of Siva, the supreme soul. What remains after the preceptor .has partaken of food shall be used by the disciple. It will purify him. Just as Siva\'s leaving of food can be taken by the devotee of Siva, so also the disciple can take the leavings of the preceptor. Even food and water, 0 brahmins.</li>' +
'<li>Without the permission of the preceptor, anything taken is a theft. One shall accept as one\'s preceptor a person who knows many special things. </li>' +
'<li>Freedom from ignorance is the goal. Only a specialist can achieve that. In order to fulfil a task, or a sacred rite, obstacles must be warded off. A rite performed without hindrances in the middle can be fruitful. The subsidiary rites shall also be performed. Hence at the beginning of sacred rites, an intelligent man shall adore Ganesa. </li>' +
'<li>An intelligent man must worship all deities in order to ward off all sorts of hindrances. (There are three types of hindrances. The first one, the Adhyatmika hindrance is the ailment of the body, whether it is a fever or a tremor or other type of sickness. </li>' +
'<li>The second type of hindrance is Adhibhautika (Extraneous one of a physical nature). The visitations of Pisacas, the outcome of ant-hills etc, falling of lizards and other insects, ths advent of tortoise inside the house, infesting of serpents, untimely flowering of trees, deliveries in inauspicious hours and other things indicate some future misery. Hence these are called Adhibhautika hindrances. </li>' +
'<li>The third type of hindrance is Adhidaivika (Divine calami .. ties). When lightning strikes, small pox, cholera, plague, typhus fever and similar infectious diseases spread and bad awful dreams, evil planets affecting the birth star or Rasi (sign of the zodiac) occur, these hindrances are called Adhidaivika. In order to ward off these hindrances and on • occasions when one touches a corpse, a candala or a fallen man and goes inside without bathing, Santi Yajna shall be performed to remove the evil effects. </li>' +
'<li>The precincts of a temple, a cowshed, a sanctuary or one\'s own court-yard shall be selected for the performance of sacrifice. It shall be on a raised platform at least two hastas high. It shaH be well decorated. Paddy weighing a Bhara shall be spread on the ground to make a large circle. Diagrams of lotuses shall be made in the middle and in the eight quarters on the border of the circle. A big pot round which a thread is tied, shall be placed in the middle and eight other similar pots shall be placed in the eight quarters. All of them shall he fumigated with Guggulu. </li>' +
'<li>In the eight pots bunches of mango leaves shall be placed with Darbha grass. They shall be filled with water purified by mantras and five kinds of articles. </li>' +
'<li>Precious gems shall be put in the nine vesseJs, one in each. The sensible devotee shall ask his preceptor to preside as a priest. The presiding priest shall be accompanied by his wife. He shall be well-versed in the rituals. </li>' +
'<li>Gold idols of the guardians of the quarters and Visnu shall be put in the different vessels. Visnu shall be invoked and worshipped in the central vessel. </li>' +
'<li>The respective guardians of the different quarters shall be worshipped in the vessels concerned, using the dative case after the name and ending with Namah. </li>' +
'<li>The invocation shall be performed by the presiding priest.. Along with the Ritviks he shall repeat the mantras a hundred times. </li>' +
'<li>At the end of the Japas, Homa shall be performed to the west of the vessel. According to the time, place and convenience, the offerings in the fire may be a crore, a hundred thousand, a thousand, or hundred and eight in number. It shall be performed for a single day, for nine days or for forty days.</li>' +
'<li>The sacrificial twigs shall be of Sami tree if the rite is intended for Santi (suppression of evil effects) or of Palasa tree if the rite is intended for the acquisition of • livelihood. Cooked rice and ghee shall also be used. The offerings shall be made by repeating the names of the deities or mantras. </li>' +
'<li>The articles of worship used in the beginning shall be continued till the end. • At the conclusion, the Punyahavacana shall be performed and the holy water sprinkled over the different members of the family. </li>' +
'<li>Brahmins, as many in number as the number of offerings made, shall be fed, 0 scholarly sages, the preceptor and the presiding priest shall partake of sacrificial food alone. </li>' +
'<li>The entire rite shall conclude after the worship of nine planets. A gem along with monetary gifts shall be given to each of the Rtviks. </li>' +
'<li>Different types of gifts shall be made to deserving persons, to boys invested with sacred threads, to householders, sages, virgins, ladies and widows. The materials used for the rite shall be given to the priest.</li>' +
'<li>Yama is the presiding deity of all calamities, grave diseases etc. Hence to gratify Yama Kaladana shall be made. </li>' +
'<li>A replica of Kala (God of death) in the form of a man holding noose and goad shall be made in gold using a hundred or ten Niskas (gold coins). This shall be given as gift along with the sacrificial fee; gingelly seeds shall be gifted for the sake of longevity. </li>' +
'<li>Ghee or mirror shall be gifted for the sake of quelling ailments. Rich men shall feed a thousand brahmins. The poor shall feed a hundred brahmins. Indigent persons shall perform rites according to their capacity. For the quiescence of evil spirits the great adoration of Bhairava shall be performed. </li>' +
'<li>At the conclusion, Mahabhiseka and Naivedya shall be offered to Siva. Then a public feeding of the brahmins shall be held. </li>' +
'<li>By performing sacrifice in this way there will be an alleviation of all defects and evils. This Santi Yajna shall be performed every year in the month of Phalguna. </li>' +
'<li>In regard to evil dreams and ill omens this shall be performed instantly or definitely within a month. When one is defiled by a great sin, the worship of Bhairava shall be performed. </li>' +
'<li>In regard to great diseases like leprosy etc. the vow shall first be taken and the sacrifice performed later on. Indigent persons wanting in all these things shall make gift of a lamp to the deity. </li>' +
'<li>If incapable of even that, he shall take bath and make any gift. Or he shall make obeisance to the Sun·god hundred and eight times repeating the mantras. </li>' +
'<li>A devotee shall perform prostrations and obeisance a thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, or a crore in number. All the deities are delighted by the obeisance· sacrifice in this way. </li>' +
'<li>The obeisance is performed with the prayer "0 lord, Thou are great and I am humble. My intellect is dedicated to Thee. A void thing does not appeal to thee. I am no longer void. I am Thy slave now. Whatever vestige of egotism remained in me has been dispelled on seeing Thee." </li>' +
'<li>Namaskara, a sacrifice of the soul, shall be performed according to apility. Sacrificial food and betel leaves shall be offered to Siva. </li>' +
'<li>The devotee himself shall perform a hundred and eight circumambulations of Siva. Such circumambulations, a thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand or a crore in number he shall cause to be performed through others. </li>' +
'<li>All sins perish instantaneously at the circumambulations of Siva. Sickness is the root·cause of misery and sin is the cause of sickness. </li>' +
'<li>Sins are said to be quelled by virtue. A sacred rite performed with Siva in view is capable of removing all sins. </li>' +
'<li>Among the sacred rites of Siva, the circumambulation ·leads the rest. Pranava is in the form of Japa and circumambulation is a physical rite. </li>' +
'<li>The pair of births and deaths constitutes the Illusory cycle. The Balipitha of Siva is symbolic of this Mayacakra. </li>' +
'<li>Starting from pedestal the devotee shall make circumambulation half the way and return to the pedestal [and move anticlockwise to the place where he stopped before and returning to the pedestal make the circle complete]. This is the procedure of circumambulation. When the birth_ takes place, the obeisance which is the dedication of the soul prevents further birth. </li>' +
'<li>The pair of births and deaths originates from the Maya of Siva. After such a dedication the devotee is not born again. </li>' +
'<li>As long as the body exists, the Jiva is dependent on activities and he is spoken of as being in bondage. :But when the three forms of the physical body are under control it is called "Salvation" by the scholars. </li>' +
'<li>Siva, the primary cause of causes, is the Creator of Mayacakra. He wipes off the Dvandva-birth and deathwhich originates from His Maya. </li>' +
'<li>The Dvandva is conceived and created by Siva. It shall be dedicated to Him. 0 scholars, it shall be known that circumambulation is highly pleasing to Siva. </li>' +
'<li>The circumambulation and obeisance of Siva, the great soul and the adoration performed with sixteen Upacaras accord all benefits. </li>' +
'<li>There is no sin in the world which cannot be destroyed by circumambulation. Hence one should dispel all sins by circumambulation alone. </li>' +
'<li>A person observing worship of Siva shall observe silence and perform one of these-a sacred rite, penance, Japa, maintenance of the knowledge or meditation. He shall observe truthfulness etc. </li>' +
'<li>ll sorts of riches, divine body, knowledge, removal of ignorance and nearness to Siva are the results of sacred rites etc. </li>' +
'<li>The sacred rite yields the benefit by the performance. It removes the darkness of ignorance. It wipes off future birth. By the achievement of true knowledge, the miseries shall seem as if they did not exist at all. </li>' +
'<li>The true devotee of Siva shall pbserve the sacred rites etc. in accordance with the place, time, physical ability, possession of wealth as befitting his state. </li>' +
'<li>The intelligent devotee shall take up his residence in a holy centre of Siva, desist from violence to living beings, without exposing himself to undue strain, and spending only such wealth as he earns by legitimate means. </li>' +
'<li>Even water sanctified by the five-syllabled mantra is conducive to happiness like cooked food. Even the alms begged and acquired by an indigent devotee is conducive to perfect knowledge. </li>' +
'<li>Charitable food of a devotee of Siva increases devotion to Siva. Sivayogins call such charitable food sacrificial offerings to Siva. ,.. </li>' +
'<li>The devotee of Siva shall always be scrupulous about the purity of his food, wherever he stays and whatever means of sustenance he has. He shall observe silence and shall not disclose the secret. </li>' +
'<li>o the devotees he shall expound the greatness of Siva. Only Siva can know the secret of Sivamantra. No one else. </li>' +
'<li>The devotee of Siva shall always resort to the phallic emblem of Siva. 0 brahmins, one becomes Siva by resorting to stationary phallic emblem. </li>' +
'<li>By worshipping the mobile phallic image the liberation is certainly gradual. Thus I have mentioned the achievable and the excellent means of achievement. </li>' +
'<li>What has been mentioned formerly by Vyasa and what has been heard by me before, has been mentioned to you. Welfare attend ye all. May our devotion to Siva be stable and firm. </li>' +
'<li>0 scholars, whoever reads this chapter by Siva\'s grace and whoever listens to this always shall acquire the knowledge of Siva. </li></ol>' + '<br/><a href=\'#top\'><strong>Back To Top</strong></a></p>',

'<li>Among the eight<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (89)</note> cosmic bodies of Siva, the Earthen body is the best. Since it is not worshipped by any one else 0 Brahmal)as! it yields great benefit. </li>' +
'<li>Just as Siva is the oldest and the most excellent of all deities, so also his earthly phallic image is the most excellent of all. </li>' +
'<li>Just as the celestial river Ganga is the oldest and the most excellent of all rivers, so also is the earthen phallic image of Siva the most excellent of all. </li>' +
'<li>Just as the Pranava is considered the greatest of all mantras, so also the earthen phallic image of Siva that is worthy to be worshipped, is the most excellent of all. </li>' +
'<li>Just as the brahmin is spoken of as the most excellent of all Varnas so also is the-earthen phallic image of Siva the most excellent of all other phallic images.</li>' +

'<li>D.iscarding the worship of the earthen phallic image if any one were to worship another deity, that worship becomes fruitless. Ceremonial ablutions, charitable gifts etc. are of no avail. </li>' +
'<li>The propitiation of the earthen phallic image is sanctifying, bestower of bliss, longevity, satiety, nourishment and fortune. It must be observed by all good aspirants. </li>' +
'<li>A devotee endowed with unflinching faith shall worship the earthen phallic image with such modes of service as are easily available. It accords the achievement of all desired objects. </li>' +
'<li>He who worships the earthen phallic image after constructing an auspicious altar becomes affluent and glorious here itself and becomes Rudra in the end.</li>' +

'<li>He who worships the earthen phallic emblem of Siva every day stays in Sivaloka for so many years of Siva, as he had been visiting Siva\'s temple in his life. If he had any wish he would be reborn in the land of Bharata as a sovereign monarch</li>' +

'<li>Whether it is made of gems, gold, mercury, crystals or Pusparaga it shall be a single whole. </li>' +
'<li>All mobile phallic emblems shall be a single whole. Stationary phallic images shall be made of two pieces. This is the rule about broken and unbroken phallic images both immobile or mobile. </li>' +
'<li>The pedestal is the great Maya; the phallic image is lord Siva. Hence in immobile image two-piece construction is recommended. </li>' +
'<li>This has been mentioned by those who know the principles of Saiva cult that a stationary phallic image shall be made of two pieces. </li>' +

notes: ['89. SB (6.1. 3· 1-18) gives the following version of the eight forms of Siva : "When the life-principle became manifest it had no nam.e, so it cried. Prajapati asked the reason and being informed that the child wanted a name, first gave him the name Rudra, then Sarva, Pasupati Ugra, Asani, Bhava, Mahadeva and ISana. This was the conception from. which the purana writers developed the Astamiirti conception of Siva. The fact is that the eight forms of Siva symbolise the five gross material elements (ether, air, fire, water, and earth), two opposite principles of Prlh;ta and Apana (heat and colcl represented by the sun and the moon) and the principle of mind ( lfiffi") which is the eighth.

'r47. Three-eyed Siva, so called because a third eye burst from his forehead with a great fiame when his wife playfully placed her hands over his eyes after he had been engaged in austerities in the Himalayas. This eye has been very destructive. It reduced Kama, the God of Love, to ashes. Dowson, H.M. See under Trilocana'
,'149· It is said that Daksa\'s sacrifice being destroyed by the Ganas of Siva assumed the form of a goat while Dak~a became a deer and escaped. A devotee who imitates the sound of a terror~struck goat in the presence of the phallic image of Siva pleases the God. ']

The prison cell of Devaki and Vasudeva became fragrant with pleasing odors; it cast a wondrous light and was filled with inexplicable music and jingling of dancing feet. Devaki and Vasudeva became aware of these happenings, but they were afraid to inform Kamsa, lest in his vindictive frenzy, he might hack the womb to pieces. They were anxious about the strange future of the son to be born and were restless with weird forebodings.</p>',

Hearing these words of Suka, Parikshith said, “What foolishness is this? Knowing fully well that his end was drawing near, should he not give up his greed and turn his mind towards God?” Suka burst into laughter and said, “Maharaja! You think that all those whose end is near will utilize the time at their disposal to seek the vision of the Lord! Such yearning can arise in the mind only due to good deeds performed in the previous lives. Those who have acquired good merits from their past actions, have compassion towards all beings, do not swerve from the right path and adhere to truth, non-violence and love. They have only thoughts of God and urge to do sanctifying deeds till their last days. Instead, those who are immersed in selfishness, egotism, greed, vice, violence and unrighteousness will suffer from increased evil urges in their last days and destroy themselves.

Rohini gave birth to a son who was named as Balarama because of his extraordinarily strong body and his charming innocence and intelligence. Since he was transferred from the womb of Devaki to Rohini, he was also called Samkarshana (who was attracted or drawn). Meanwhile, the eighth pregnancy completed nine months; Devaki and Vasudeva sat helpless in great anguish without food or sleep fearing what would Kamsa do next. Kamsa took extra precautions to see that the child does not escape him. He ordered that Vasudeva and Devaki be shackled with chains on hand and feet. But, who can hinder the inscrutable operation of the will of God?"</p>'

Just then, there was an effulgent Form with a strange splendor standing before her. Gradually, the Form became clear! It was armed with the Conch, the Discus and the Mace; the fourth hand was held in Abhaya pose. It said softly and sweetly, “Do not fear! I am Narayana. I am to be born in a few minutes as your son in an answer to the promise I made as a result of your earnest prayers. I will be known as Krishna and also as Vasudeva. As soon as I am born, the shackles will fall off from your hands and feet. The doors of the prison will open by themselves. Take Me from here without anyone’s knowledge, to the home of Nanda in Gokula. Place Me by the side of his wife, Yasoda who is having labor pains now. Bring the baby girl that Yasoda has delivered back into this prison and keep her with you. Then, send word to Kamsa. Until he gets the news, no one either in Mathura or Gokula will notice you. I shall arrange it so.” Blessing Devaki and Vasudeva, the effulgent Form entered the womb of Devaki as an Orb of Light. Within minutes the Divine Child was born! It was 3:30AM. The shackles that bound the hands and feet of Vasudeva fell off in a trice. The doors and the gates flew open. Though it was still dark, a cuckoo was cooing with a sudden spurt of joy. The Rain-God was showering flower drops of rain on the earth. Around the prison, flocks of bird clustered in happy song, twittering sweet melody. Vasudeva turned his eyes towards the new born child and was astounded. Encircling the Babe was a brilliant halo of Light!</em></p>'

He tore an old sari of Devaki and covered the Babe and placed the basket on his head. He moved out of the open doors and gates, past the sleeping guards. He noticed the little drops of rain that was falling on the Babe and was afraid that the Babe would be soaked. But, when he turned back, he found a snake following his footsteps, holding the ribbed umbrella of its broad hoods over the child preventing the rain from wetting the Babe. He soon realized that it was Adisesha protecting the Lord. Though the sun had not risen yet, the lotus bloomed in all the tanks and leaned on its stalk towards the Babe. Though it was a dark night, with a deep yearning to look at the Babe, the full moon peeped through the clouds, with its cool rays illuminating the entire route to Gokul. Vasudeva began to cross Yamuna river to reach Gokul. The water was rising very rapidly above Vasudeva’s head and he was afraid that he would drown. It dawned on him that Yamuna was paying its respects to the Lord by wetting the feet of the Babe! The Babe was placed next to Yashoda and the baby girl that had just been born there was brought and placed into the hands of Devaki. No sooner this was done, Vasudeva burst into tears! While these words were coming from Suka’s lips, Parikshith exclaimed aloud, “Krishna, Krishna!” Everyone looked at the King. They saw a snake crawling away fast, after biting the right toe of the King. Suka shed tears of Bliss; He announced, “The King has merged with the Lord”. The word Suka means parrot. Yes, he was the parrot that plucked the ripe nectar filled fruit called Bhagavatha from the tree of the Vedas and enabled the world to taste it. May the world relish the fruit and derive the Atmic Bliss!</p>'
