Lord Shiva then sent Nabhag to his father Shradhadev to know about his opinion.

He also told him that whatever remained after the accomplishment of the yagya belongs to lord Shiva only.</p>' +
'<p>Nabhag was now satisfied. He went back to lord Shiva and narrated everything what his father had said. He then eulogized and worshipped lord Shiva. Lord Shiva blessed him which helped Nabhag to attain salvation. </p>' ,
