    <li>Sati thiought to hersef: "I shall be her daugher" and cast off her body in order to become the daughter of Himacala</li>
    <li>At the appropriate time, Sati who had cast off her body and who was worshipped and eulogised by the Gods became the daughter of Mena out of sheer joy.</li>
    <li>On being advised by Narada, the Goddess who was named Parvati, performed a severe penance and thereby secured Shiva as her husband</li>

    <li>Oh sage Narada, you listen to the story of the origin of Parvati's mother and her marriage and other details both santifying and condusive to the growth of devotion.</li>
    <li>O excellent Sage, there in the Northern region is a mountain called Himavat who is the Lord of mountains and has great splendour and prosperity</li>
    <li>His twofold aspects - that of a mobile nature and that of the immobile one are well kmown. I succintly describe his subtle form</li>
    <li>He is beautiful and is the storehouse of multifarous gems. Extending from the eastern to the western ocean, he appears like a measuring rod of the Earth.</li>
    <li>He abounds in various trees. Being of variegated shape and features, he is adorned by many peaks on him. Lions, tigers and other animals frequent it. Manu happy persons live there for ever</li>
    <li>He is the storehouse of snow (and yet) very fierce. He is the resort of wonderful things. He is resorted to by Gods, sages and seers. He is a great favorite of Siva</li>
    <li>He is of a divine form. He is beautiful in every part. he is the unaffected part of Visnu. He is the king of leading mountains and a great favorite of the good
    </li>
    <li>Due to the desire for the benefit of the manes and the Gods and for the stabilization of his race as well as for the increase of virtue, Himacala wanted to marry</li>
    <li>In the company of Uma, Rudra became a householder and the great lord performed divine sports. He of undecaying intellect deluded me even at the time of his marriage.</li>
    <li>At that time, considering their own interest entirely O excellent sage, the Gods approached the Celestial forefathers and said lovingly to them </li>
    <em><span style="font-weight:900;color:#ff4443;font-size:larger">The Gods Said:  </span>
    <li>"O ye forefathers, listen to our words with pleasure. If you desire that the affairs of the Gods be fulfilled, you must act accordingly soon"</li>
    <li>Uniting your eldest daughter Mena of auspicious features with Himacala, a great benefit will accrue to everyone. At every step, the miseries of the Gods, and those of yours as well can be reduced</li>

    <li>They gave their daughter Mena to Himavat. In that auspicious marriage, there were great festivities</li>
    <li>Giving many charitable gifts, they made the celebration a great success. They praised the celestial forefathers and Himavat</li>

      <li>0 Narada and other sages, dear one, listen to the narrative of the origin on Mena. O excellent son, O great Scholar, I shall mention it now.</li>
      <li>O sage, I have already told you about my son Daksa, who had sixty daughters all of whom were the instruments of creation</li>
      <li>He celebrated their marriages with Kasyapa and other bridegrooms. O Narada, now listen to the present story.</li>
      <li>Amongst those, Savadha was given to the Forefathers. She had three daughters, each with handsome features and virtuous form</li>
      <li>O sage listen to their Holy names which remove obstacles and confer blesssings</li>
      <li>Mena was the eldest, Dhanya was the middle one and Kalavati was the youngest. All three were mentally concieved daughters of the Forefathers</li>
      <li>They were not born of the womb of Svadha, but conventionally considerered here children. On reciting their names, men can achieve their desires</li>
      <li>The mothers of the worlds are worthy of the reverence of the entire universe always. They are the bestowers of great joy. They are great Yogins. They pervade the 
      three worlds</li>

      <li>After bowing to and eulogizing Lord Visnu, they halted there at His bidding. A great concourse of people was held there.</li>
      <li>O Sage, at the same time, Siddhas sons of Brahma - Sanaka and others came here. They too bowed to and lauded Visnu and stayed there at his bidding</li>
      <li>On seeing the Sages, Sanaka and others, the persons who had assembled there stood up. When they, the elders of Gods sat down, the people all bowed to them</li>
      <li>Helpless by misfortune and deluded by Lord Shiva's illusion, the three sisters did not stand up</li>
      <li>Shive's illusion is weighty and capable of deluding the Worlds. The entire Universe is subservient to it. It is also called Shiva's Will</li>
      <li>The same is also called an action that has begun to fuctify. Its names are many. Everything takes place on Shiva's wish. There is nothing to be pondered in this respect</li>
      <li>Becoming victims of this thereof, the sisters did not make obeisance to them. They remained surprised and stunned thereafter seeing them</li>
      <li>On seeing such a behavior on their part, the Great Sages, Sanaka and others despite being wise became, unbearably furious</li>

          <li>0 Sage, lovingly listen to the auspicious glory of Siva on which even a slayer of Brahmins becomes pure and attains all desires.</li>
          <li>O Narada. there was great pomp and ceremony in all three Worlds when Himacala returned to his abode after marrying Mena.</li>
          <li>The delighted Himacala too celebrated a great festival. With good intent, we worshipped and revered Brahmin kinsmen and others</li>
          <li>The contented Brahmins returned to their respective abodes after blessing them. The kinsmen and others also returned</li>
          <li>The delighted Himacala sported with Mena in his cosy abode, Nandana<noteref1_note1footer>(1) - (6)</note>, other parts, as well as in several nice places</li>
          <li>At that time, O sage, Vishnu, the Gods and the noble sages approached the mountain.</li>
          <li>On seeing them after their arrival, the noble Himacala bowed to them gladly and honoured them with devotion. He praised his own good fortune </li>
          <li>With head bent down and palms joined in reverence, he eulogized them with great devotion. Himacala's hair stood on end and tears of love fell from his eyes</li>
          <li>O Sage, after bowing to them, the delighted Himacala spoke thus to Visnu and other Gods</li>
          <span style="font-weight:900;color:crimson;font-size:larger"> Himacala said:  </span>
          <li>Today my life has become fruitful. My good penance has become fruitful. Today my knowledge has become fruitful. Today my sacred rites have become fruitful.</li>

              <li>O Goddess, neither the Vedas, nor the sacred texts know you perfectly. Your greatness, O Siva, is beyond the scope of speech and mind and cannot even be
              meditated on</li>

              <li>O great Goddess listen to our submission, which we, your slaves for ever, are going to explain.</li>
              <li>Formerly you were born as the daughter of Daksa and married to Siva. You destroyed the great misery of Shree Brahma and others</li>
              <li>Being disrespected by your father, you cast off your body in accordance with your vow. You then went to your own world and Siva became miserable.</li>
              <li>O great Goddess, the purpose of the Gods has not been completely carried out. The Sages are agitated. Hence we Gods have sought refuge in you.</li>
              <li>O great Goddess, please fulfile the desire of the God, O  Shiva, so that the words of Sage Sanatkumara may be fruitful.</li>

              <li>Saying so, Visnu and the other Gods, full of loving devotion remained waiting silently and humbly</li>
              <li>Siva too was delighted on hearing the eulogy of the Gods and ascertaining the course of the same after remembering her Lord Siva, the compassionate Uma addressed smilingly, the Gods, chief of whom was 
              Visnu. The Goddess favorably disposed to her devotees said</li>

              <li>O Visnu, O Brahma, O Gods and sages who are free from sorrow and pain you listen to my words. I am delighted undoubtedly.</li>
              <li>My activities are condusive to happiness everywhere in the three worlds. The delusion of Daksa and other things were carried out by me alone</li>
              <li>I shall take a full incarnation on the Earth. There is no doubt in this. There are also many reasons for the same. I shall mention them with respect</li>
              <li>Formerly, O Gods, with great devotion, Himacala and Mena rendered service to me in my life as Sati, like my parents</li>
              <li>Even now they continuously render me service abd Mena particularly (does so). There is no doubt about my becoming their daughter.</li>
              <li>Just as you, Rudra too, desires my incarnation in the abode of Himavat. Hence I shall incarnate. That shall be the end of misery in the world.</li>
              <li>All of you return to your abodes. You shall be happy for a long time. After incarnating, I shall give Mena full happiness</li>
              <li>I shall become Siva's wife. But this desire is a great secret with me. Siva's divine sport is wonderful. It deludes even the wise</li>
              <li>Ever since I cast of my body born of Daksa, on seeing my Lord's disrespect at the hands of my father at the altar of sacrifice, my Lord Rudra is tormented by thoughts about me.</li>
              <li>He saw my anger at the altar of my father's sacrifice. Thinking that the virtuous lady had cast off her body out of love for him, he became a Yogin and abandoned
              home life. He assumed an unearthly form and features. But he could not bear my separation</li>
              <li>On the account of me he was much distressed. He put on an abnormal dress. Ever since he forsook the excellent pleasure of love</li>
              <li>Hear further, O Visnu, O Brahma, O Sages and O Gods, the divine sports of the Supreme Lord Shiva that protect the Universe</li>
              <li>Oppressed by the pangs of bereavement, he wreathed a garland of my bones. Although he is the sole enlightened God, he could not get peace anywhere</li>
              <li>Like a non God, like a helpless creature, he roamed about here and there and cried aloud. The Lord himself could not distinguish between proper and improper.</li>
              <li>The Lord Shiva did this just to show the behavior of a love-lorn lover. He blabbered like a lover in depair due to separation.</li>
              <li>But really the Supreme Lord has no aberrations, is not distressed and remains unconquered. My master Shiva is perfect, Lord of all, 
              and controller of illusion.</li>
              <li>He is not tarnished by illusion. Of what avail are illusion, love and other emotions for Him?</li>
              <li>Rudra, the Lord, is anxious to marry me and hence my incarnation on Earth at the residence of Mena and Himavat, O Gods.</li>
              <li>In order to propitate Rudra, I shall incarnate as the daughter of Mena, wife of Himavat, in accordance withe the ways of the World.</li>
              <li>After performing severe penance as His devotee, I shall become Rudra's beloved and perform the work of the Gods. This is the truth,
              real truth; there is no doubt about it.</li>
              <li>All of your return to your abodes. Continuously worship Lord Shiva. Undoubtedly your miseries will be quelled by His favor</li>
              <li>By the grace of the merciful Lord Shiva, you will achieve auspicious results. As His wife, I shall be honoured and worshipped in the World</li>

                  <li>At the end of twenty seven years, Uma the beloved of Shiva, the Mother of the World and identical with the universe became highly delighted.</li>

                      <li>Then the couple, with great devotion, remembered the Goddess for her birth in order to carry out the work of the Gods</li>
                      <li>Then the Goddess who had formerly cast off her body to spite her father, by means of her Yogic powers, desired to be born to the wife of the (Lord of the) mountains.</li>
                      <li>In order to make her own words true, the Great Goddess who bestows everything desired, delightedly entered the mind of the mountain with her constituent elements</li>
                      <li>Hence he shone with an extraorordinary splendour and great joy. With a resplendant brilliance, he, of lofty mind, became invincible like a blazing fire.</li>
                      <li>Then in the beneficent hour, the lord of the mountains deposited in his beloved, the entire constituent element of Siva by means of ecstatic contemplation</li>
                      <li>The wife of lord of the mountains, by grace of the Goddess who had sympathetically stationed in the mind of the mountain, concieved.</li>
                      <li>The beloved of the mountain, Mena, shone all the more by the presence of the Goddess who bore the entire Universe. She appeared as if she was a brilliant sphere.</li>
                      <li>Mena bore the characteristic signs of pregnancy which almost indicated the imminent rise in pleasure of her lord and served as the auspicious cause of the future bliss of the Gods</li>
                      <li>The weakness in her body did not allow her to wear ornaments. Her face became pale like the Lodhra flower. She resembled the night where there are very few stars and the Moon is in a waning state</li>
                      <li>Kissing her face, emitting the fragrance of the Earth in the course of his secret dalliance, the lord of the mountain was not satiated. His love increased.</li>
                      <li>The lord of the mountains asked Mena's friends frequently - "What are her desires? She herself does not express them out of bashfulness"</li>
                      <li>Whatever the product of the mountain she wished to have in the course of her pregnancy, she found brought to her. There was nothing which he, the lord of the Mountains could not accomplish in the
                      Heaven too.</li>
                      <li>Surmounting the difficulties of the early days of pregnancy, she grew more plump in her limbs. Mena then shone like a tender creeper putting forth more leaves and flowers.</li>
                      <li>The lord of the mountains comnsidered his pregnant queen like the Earth with a treasure within and like the Sami twig with latent fire in it.</li>
                      <li>The intelligent lord of the mountains performed all the sacred rites befitting the love for his wife, the loftiness of his mind, the vastness of the riches earned by him and the injunctions of the Vedas</li>
                      <li>At the proper time, he saw his wife Mena about to be delivered of the child, with delight, as one sees the sky enveloped with clouds. The lord of the mountains felt greatly rejoiced on seeing 
                      his wife of sound and auspicious in limbs the "labour chamber" presided over by physicians. She felt very brilliant with the Mother of the Universe in her womb.</li>
                      <li>In the mean time, O Sage, Visnu and other gods, as well as the sages came there and eulogised Siva who was in the womb.</li>

                      <li>When nine months were completed, in the tenth month, the Goddess, the Mother of the Universe, bore all the states of a child in the womb in the complete form.</li>
                      <li>The time was good, the planets, stars and luminary heavenly bodies were quiet. The sky was clear and there was brilliance in all the quarters</li>
                      <li>The Earth consisting of forests, vilages and oceans was very auspicious. Lotuses blossomed in lakes, rivers and tanks.</li>
                      <li>O excellent sage, diverse winds gentle to the touch blew; god men rejoiced and bad people became unhappy.</li>

                      <li>Coming out of the belly of Mena at the proper time in her real form, she represented Laxmi coming out of the ocean.</li>

                      <li>Along with the rain, there was a shower of flowers. Fires calmly glowed and the clouds rumbled. </li>
                      <li>At the time of her birth, riches and prosperity flourished in the city of Himavat. All miseries perished.</li>
                      <li>Visnu and other Gods reached there in time and saw the Mother of the Universe. They were delighted and happy.</li>

                          <li>The Goddess Kali of exquisite body and comely appearance aquired more and more splendour like the disk of the moon acquiring more and more digits day by day</li>

                          <li>Afterwards when Kali wanted to perform a penance, she was forbidden by her mother who said, "O no (U ma)" Hence O sage the sweet faced lady came to be called Uma in the world.</li>
                          <li>Although he had many sons, the eyes of the mountain were never satiated on seeing the child Parvati endowed with good fortune. In the spring season, there may be many flowers in full bloom,

                          <li>O Sage, the Goddess Siva when the suitable time for her education arrived, learnt all the lores from a good perceptor, with concentrated mind and great pleasure.</li>
                          <li>Just as the flock of swans returns to the Ganga in the autumnal season and just as the brilliant lustre manifests itself in the medicinal herbs during the night, so also all the learning of the
                          previous birth retured to Kali.</li>
                          <li>O sage, this I have described one of the divine sports of Siva. I shall narrate another of her divine sports. You listen to it lovingly.</li>

'<p>Lord Brahma and Narada tried to console and convince her, but it was of no avail. When Himalaya tried to intervene, he was soundly rebuked. Maina threatened him that if this marriage took place then it would be the last day of her life.</p>' +
'<p>At last lord Vishnu arrived and tried to pacify her anger by saying that her anger was baseless as she had not seen the real appearance of Shiva, which bestows benediction. Lord Vishnu and Narada then eulogised Shiva who on being pleased showed his most enchanting beauty. </p>' +
'<p>Maina now became fully satisfied. Himalaya too felt proud of her daughter\'s good fortune. At last Shiva entered the Mandap (canopy) where marriage ceremony was going to be organised. He saw Parvati sitting there. Both of them were very delighted to see each other.</p>' +
'<p>After the marriage ceremony was over, Sage Garg helped Himalaya in performing the rite of Kanyadan, amidst the chantings of vedic mantras. The women  were singing auspicious songs. Himalaya presented large quantities of dowry to Shiva. Parvati\'s companions were engaged with Shiva in jocular and humorous conversation.</p>' +
'<p>Rati- the wife of Kamadeva, seeing the moment opportune, arrived and requested Shiva to bring back her dead husband back to life. Her wailings made the other goddesses very sympathetic towards her. They too requested Shiva to make her dead husband back to life.</p>' +
'<p>Feeling pity on her condition. Shiva brought back Kamadeva back to life from the ashes which Rati had given to him. On seeing her husband alive, Rati\'s heart was filled up with extreme joy. Both of them eulogised lord Shiva and expressed their gratitude.</p>' +
'<p>After the marriage ceremony was over the marriage-processionist sought the permission of Himalaya to make a move, but he requested them to remain there for some more days. </p>' ,
