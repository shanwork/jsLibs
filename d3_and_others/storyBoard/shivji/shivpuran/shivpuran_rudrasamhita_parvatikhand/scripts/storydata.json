    <li>Sati thiought to hersef: "I shall be her daugher" and cast off her body in order to become the daughter of Himacala</li>

    <li>Oh sage Narada, you listen to the story of the origin of Parvati's mother and her marriage and other details both santifying and condusive to the growth of devotion.</li>
    <li>O excellent Sage, there in the Northern region is a mountain called Himavat who is the Lord of mountains and has great splendour and prosperity</li>
    <li>His twofold aspects - that of a mobile nature and that of the immobile one are well kmown. I succintly describe his subtle form</li>
    <li>He is beautiful and is the storehouse of multifarous gems. Extending from the eastern to the western ocean, he appears like a measuring rod of the Earth.</li>
    <li>He abounds in various trees. Being of variegated shape and features, he is adorned by many peaks on him. Lions, tigers and other animals frequent it. Manu happy persons live there for ever</li>
    <li>He is the storehouse of snow (and yet) very fierce. He is the resort of wonderful things. He is resorted to by Gods, sages and seers. He is a great favorite of Siva</li>
    <li>He is of a divine form. He is beautiful in every part. he is the unaffected part of Visnu. He is the king of leading mountains and a great favorite of the good
    </li>
    <li>Due to the desire for the benefit of the manes and the Gods and for the stabilization of his race as well as for the increase of virtue, Himacala wanted to marry</li>
    <li>In the company of Uma, Rudra became a householder and the great lord performed divine sports. He of undecaying intellect deluded me even at the time of his marriage.</li>
    <li>At that time, considering their own interest entirely O excellent sage, the Gods approached the Celestial forefathers and said lovingly to them </li>
    <em><span style="font-weight:900;color:#ff4443;font-size:larger">The Gods Said:  </span>
    <li>"O ye forefathers, listen to our words with pleasure. If you desire that the affairs of the Gods be fulfilled, you must act accordingly soon"</li>
    <li>Uniting your eldest daughter Mena of auspicious features with Himacala, a great benefit will accrue to everyone. At every step, the miseries of the Gods, and those of yours as well can be reduced</li>

    <li>They gave their daughter Mena to Himavat. In that auspicious marriage, there were great festivities</li>
    <li>Giving many charitable gifts, they made the celebration a great success. They praised the celestial forefathers and Himavat</li>
    <li>All the Gods and sages rejoiced and returned to their abodes with their hearts set on Siva</li>
    <li>After receiving many articles as gifts and marrying the beloved lady Mena, the lord of the mountains returned to his abode and rejoiced</li>

When Ganesha and Kartikeya came to know about the plan of their marriage both of them started quarreling among themselves as to who should get married first.</p>' +
'<p>Lord Shiva and Parvati devised a plan to sort out this problem. They told them that whoever between them return after circumambulating the earth, will get married first of all.</p>' +
'<p>Kartikeya and Ganesha agreed. Kartikeya proceeded on his journey to circumambulate the earth. Ganesha was very intelligent. He requested his parents - Lord Shiva and Parvati; to sit at a place together and circumambulated them for seven times and said-  </p>' +
'<p>"According to Veda, Circumambulating one\'s parents give virtues equivalent to that of circumambulating the whole earth. So now you must get me married first." </p>' +
'<p>Lord Shiva and Parvati were very impressed by his intelligence. They decided to get him married with Siddhi and Riddhi-the daughter of Vishwaroop Prajapati. In due course of time two sons were born to them Kshem and Labh.</p>' +
'<p>While Kartikeya was returning after circumambulating the whole earth, he met sage Narada on the way. He told Kartikeya about Ganesha\'s marriage. Kartikeya became very sad and felt like having been cheated by their parents.  </p>' +
'<p>When Kartikeya reached Kailash mountain he made salutations to lord Shiva and Parvati and without saying anything, went to Kraunch mountain to do his penance.</p>' +
'<p>Parvati was very sad. She went to Kraunch mountain to meet Kartikeya accompanied by Shiva. When Kartikeya saw them coming he moved to another place. Lord Shiva and Parvati followed him and ultimately met him. Both these places have religious significance. Having a darshan of Kartikeya on the full moon day of Kritika nakashatra is considered to bestows immense auspicious and destroyes all the sins of a man</p>' ,
